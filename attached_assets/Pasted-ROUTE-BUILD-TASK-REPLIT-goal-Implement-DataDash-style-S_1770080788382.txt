ROUTE: BUILD_TASK_REPLIT
goal: Implement DataDash‑style Single Row Review field editing that auto‑captures Proposed Changes and prompts Patch completion (v1), while keeping canonical nomenclature and updating docs for Kiwi audit.
constraints:

No runtime integrations (no real PDF text highlights).
Canonical terms only: Data Source, Single Row Review, Review States, Evidence Pack, Patch Draft, Submit Patch Request.
Single Row Review does not change Review State (read‑only badge).
Edits deterministic; stored in local session state only.
files_in_scope:
index.html
single_row_review_view.md
TASKS_UI.md
AUDIT_LOG.md (only if adding new event types)
implementation_steps:
SRR‑UI‑01 Field Cards + Groups/Filters
Requirements:
Replace left list with field cards (label + api_name, value, chips: Edited / Needs Patch / Required (Schema Stub)).
Add group selector (stub with 3+ groups) and filter chips: All, Edited, Needs Patch, RFI.
Keep alphabetical fallback; schema-order stub allowed.
Acceptance tests:
Left panel shows field cards (not a simple list).
At least 3 groups exist in UI (stub ok).
Edited fields visually differ from unchanged fields.
SRR‑PATCH‑01 Inline edit auto‑creates Proposed Change
Requirements:
Field values editable; on blur/Enter capture from/to and create/update proposed_change by field name.
Populate right panel Proposed Changes list automatically.
Mark field card as Edited and Needs Patch when patch detail fields are incomplete.
Acceptance tests:
Editing any field adds Proposed Change with from/to.
Proposed Change includes field label + api name.
Edited chip appears immediately after edit.
SRR‑PATCH‑02 Mini patch prompt under edited field
Requirements:
Show compact prompt under edited field: Justification (short) + Comment (optional).
Write into Evidence Pack blocks or per‑change notes field (pick one and document).
Buttons: Save Patch Draft, Undo Change.
Acceptance tests:
Mini patch prompt appears after edit.
Undo Change reverts to original and removes proposed change entry.
SRR‑GUARD‑01 Unsaved changes guard
Requirements:
If Edited fields with incomplete patch data exist, block Back to Grid with modal.
Modal options: Save Patch Draft, Discard Changes, Cancel.
Acceptance tests:
Back to Grid triggers modal when edits exist.
Discard clears edits + proposed changes.
SRR‑PATCH‑03 Patch Type stub
Requirements:
Add category selector per proposed change: Correction (default), Blacklist Flag, RFI.
Label only; V1 stub; persist in session state.
Acceptance tests:
Each proposed change shows a category value.
Category persists in session state.
Docs updates required:

single_row_review_view.md: update left panel spec to Field Cards + Groups/Filters; define edit->proposed_change behavior; define unsaved navigation guard.
TASKS_UI.md: add these SRR items with acceptance tests.
AUDIT_LOG.md: only if new UI event types are introduced (define payload contracts).
deliverables:

UI implementation in index.html.
Updated docs to match behavior.
Short diff summary + suggested commit message.
Git add/commit commands (no push claims).
