Replit Task: Align SRR/Handoff Docs with Current Implementation (7 Fixes)

Please update the docs in /Users/zacharyholwerda/Downloads/docs 2 to resolve the 7 doc inconsistencies flagged in review.

1) Artifact Store Prefixes (INTERFACES.md)
Problem: Doc lists art:/pr:/evt:/thr: prefixes, but implementation uses fs: mock filesystem paths.
Fix: Update the Artifact Store section to reflect fs: mock filesystem keying (e.g., fs:.orchestrate/workspaces/...) and note legacy prefix compatibility if needed.

File: INTERFACES.md
Location: Artifact Store (v1.5.2)

2) Forbidden Term Conflict (HANDOFF.md)
Problem: HANDOFF.md forbids “Record Inspection”, but SRR UI label explicitly uses it.
Fix: Either:

Remove “Record Inspection” from forbidden list, or
Add an exception note like:
“Record Inspection is the UI label for Single Row Review (allowed as UI label).”
File: HANDOFF.md
Location: Forbidden terms list

3) State Model Count (Single Row Review doc)
Problem: Doc claims 6‑state model but table lists 7 states (includes rfi_pending + rfi).
Fix: Update the heading to 7‑state model or consolidate the states explicitly.
Preferred: Update text to say 7‑state model.

File: single_row_review_view.md
Location: Recent Changes + Field State Model section

4) Patch Type Read‑Only vs Chips
Problem: Doc says Patch Type is read‑only, but UI uses chips.
Fix: Update doc to reflect chip selector (single row, horizontal scroll) and clarify it still auto‑defaults based on action.

File: single_row_review_view.md
Location: Patch Type Selector section

5) Changed Fields Strikethrough
Problem: Doc says old values are strikethrough; current UI removed strikeout.
Fix: Replace with “old values shown in subdued/locked style (no strikeout).”

File: single_row_review_view.md
Location: Changed Fields section

6) RFI Target + Blacklist Category (Stubbed)
Problem: Doc lists RFI target and blacklist category as active, but they’re stubbed/absent.
Fix: Mark both as “coming soon” or remove.
Preferred: keep but mark as stubbed.

File: single_row_review_view.md
Location: Blacklist + RFI sections

7) Queue Status Values
Problem: Queue schema lists pending/in_progress/completed, but workflow uses pending_review/needs_clarification/sent_to_admin/resolved.
Fix: Update schema to match actual statuses or add a mapping note.
Preferred: update to actual statuses.

File: HANDOFF.md
Location: Queue item schema/status

All 7 doc issues resolved.
Docs reflect current UI + workflow.
