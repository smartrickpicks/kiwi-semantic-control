ROLE: Replit Agent (repo editor + PR author)

REPO: smartrickpicks/kiwi-semantic-control
BRANCH: term-lock-2026-02-02
SCOPE: docs + UI label strings only (NO behavior changes)

GOAL:
Lock finalized terminology across docs + UI label strings so Evidence Pack nomenclature is canonical and Patch lifecycle language is consistent.

CANONICAL TERMS (must match exactly):
REVIEW STATES:
- To Do
- Needs Review
- Flagged
- Blocked
- Finalized

REVIEW SURFACES (UI + docs):
- All Data Grid
- Single Row Review
- Verifier Review
- Admin Approval
- Audit Log

PATCH LIFECYCLE (UI + docs):
- Patch Draft
- Patch Request
- Approved Patch
- Baseline Patch
- Promote Patch to Baseline (ONLY as the baseline mutation moment)

EVIDENCE PACK (canonical blocks):
- Observation
- Expected
- Justification
- Repro

AUTHORING ALIASES (allowed as helper text only):
- WHEN -> Observation
- THEN -> Expected
- BECAUSE -> Justification
(Repro has NO alias)

AGENTS:
- “Agent suggestion” (never “system”)
- “System-derived” (deterministic only)

STRICT RULES:
1) Never use “Queue” in UI/docs. Replace with “Review States”.
2) Never use “Patch” unqualified in UI labels and headings. Always use a lifecycle qualifier.
3) Never imply auto-fix, auto-apply, or implicit transitions.
4) Do not change routing, permissions, or workflow behavior.

FILES TO UPDATE (minimum):
- docs/overview.md (ensure Review States + transition language matches canonical)
- docs/V1/Flow-Doctrine.md (Evidence Pack + promotion wording)
- docs/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md (Evidence Pack blocks + “Smoke (Strict)” wording)
- docs/ui/ui_principles.md
- docs/ui/gate_view_mapping.md
- docs/ui/views/all_data_grid_view.md
- docs/ui/views/single_row_review_view.md  (Patch editor must be reframed as Evidence Pack authoring)
- docs/ui/views/verifier_review_view.md
- docs/ui/views/admin_approval_view.md
- docs/ui/views/promotion_view.md
- docs/AUDIT_LOG.md (ensure event names don’t conflict with canonical language)

OUTPUT REQUIRED:
A) Commit with message:
   "docs(ui): terminology lock — evidence pack + patch lifecycle + review states"
B) Open a PR from branch term-lock-2026-02-02 to main
C) In PR description include:
   - Summary of term changes
   - Files touched list
   - Explicit statement: "docs/UI-copy only; no behavior changes"
