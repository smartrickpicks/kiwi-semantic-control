    "Use the Review State Transition Matrix as the single source of allowed transitions.",
    "Use gate_view_mapping.md as the single source of gate-to-view ownership. Do not invent new gates.",
    "In verifier_review_view and admin_approval_view, reference the role-tagged REVIEW_CHECKLIST items that must be satisfied for approval, and specify what happens if evidence is missing (force 'hold'/'flag' etc. — as a contract).",
    "Maintain terminology: 'Verifier' primary; mention 'Reviewer' only once as a legacy alias in verifier.md. Use 'Promote Patch to Baseline' as stakeholder label; mention 'apply_patch' only when referring to permission name."
