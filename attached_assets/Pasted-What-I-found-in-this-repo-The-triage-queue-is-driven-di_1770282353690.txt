What I found in this repo

The triage queue is driven directly by allData.issues and allData.fieldActions, with no filtering for “supporting/reference” data. That happens in renderAllTables() in index.html (line 9361).
Those arrays are populated as‑is from whatever JSON you load: loadFromData() and loadData() assign data.sf_issues and data.sf_field_actions straight into allData with no filtering or tagging. See index.html (line 5228) and index.html (line 9608).
Queue counts are computed from allData.contractResults using sf_contract_status only; anything without a status still counts as “To Do.” See index.html (line 5892).
Why glossary terms show up

The UI assumes every row in sf_issues/sf_field_actions is actionable triage. If your glossary export or supporting tables are getting into those arrays upstream (or being treated as data rows with issues), the UI will show them — there’s no guardrail here.
This makes the misalignment a data‑classification issue, not a “rendering” issue. The queue isn’t wrong; it is faithfully showing whatever is in sf_issues/sf_field_actions.
Likely misalignment points

Upstream preview packet generation is probably emitting glossary rows into sf_issues (or sf_field_actions). The UI doesn’t differentiate source or record_type, so they look like real QA items.
If you are loading via CSV/JSON and glossary sheets are included in the dataset, nothing excludes those sheets from queue logic.
Where to fix (minimal)

Preferred (upstream fix): prevent glossary/reference sheets from becoming sf_issues or sf_field_actions in the preview packet.
UI quick fix: filter out glossary/reference items by sheet or source before rendering. The cleanest place is in loadFromData() or right before renderAllTables() in index.html.
If you want, I can implement a UI filter that excludes specific sheet names (e.g., Glossary, Field Dictionary, QA_Flags, Opportunity_Field_Catalog) or a source: 'glossary' flag if it exists in your data.

Two quick questions so I can pinpoint the exact fix

Are you seeing this after loading a Preview Packet JSON (data source modal) or after CSV/XLSX upload?
Can you paste one example “QA Flag” row from the queue JSON (just the raw object), or tell me the exact sheet value for those glossary rows?
Once I have that, I’ll wire the precise filter and show you the diff.
