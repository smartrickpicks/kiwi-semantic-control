Replit Task: Reviewer Mode — Triage + Grid + SRR (Filters, Read‑Only, Proper Routing)

Please update index.html to fully align Reviewer role behavior across Triage, All‑Data Grid, and Record Inspection (SRR). Include division + status filtering, consistent routing, and read‑only behavior.

Scope & Rules
Reviewer mode only (do not change Analyst/Admin behavior).
No row index routing. Always route by dataset_id + record_id + patch_request_id.
Reviewer views are read‑only (no inline edits).
1) Reviewer Triage (Reviewer mode only)
Data source

Build from shared PatchRequest store + reviewer queue items.
Filter out anything not assigned to reviewer (role=reviewer/verifier).
Filter bar

Division dropdown (unique division_id from queue items)
Status dropdown (pending_review, needs_clarification, sent_to_admin, resolved)
Include All option for both.
Row behavior

Clicking a row opens Verifier Review (not Analyst SRR).
RFI rows must not show Approve in table. Actions:
Open Review
Open Record (read‑only SRR with patch_request_id)
Empty state

If no items match filter: “No reviewer items match the selected filters.”
2) Reviewer All‑Data Grid (Reviewer mode only)
Read‑only

Disable inline editing and field actions.
Filter bar (same as triage)

Division + Status (same state, shared across triage/grid for reviewer).
Row highlight

Highlight rows with active PatchRequest artifacts by status:
pending_review (subtle yellow)
needs_clarification (orange)
sent_to_admin (blue)
resolved (green)
Row click

If row has patch_request_id, open Verifier Review.
If missing patch_request_id, show toast: “No PatchRequest available for this record.”
3) Reviewer Record Inspection (SRR)
Read‑only SRR

Load PatchRequest by patch_request_id then record by dataset_id + record_id.
Render:
Proposed changes (diff)
Evidence pack
Thread
Patch Tester tab only for Correction/Blacklist, hidden for RFI.
4) Filter Persistence (Reviewer only)
Store filter state in localStorage:
reviewer_filter_division
reviewer_filter_status
Restore on reload.
Acceptance
Reviewer triage + grid share division/status filters and persist them.
Reviewer grid is read‑only and highlights records by status.
Reviewer row click always routes to Verifier Review via patch_request_id.
RFI rows show view‑only actions (Open Review/Open Record).
Reviewer SRR hydrates from PatchRequest and is read‑only.
