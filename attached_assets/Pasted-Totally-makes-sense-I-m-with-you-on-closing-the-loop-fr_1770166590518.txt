Totally makes sense — I’m with you on closing the loop from verifier approval into admin, and we can keep the UX refinements for the next pass.

Here’s the **Replit task** to implement verifier approval → admin queue handoff, scoped cleanly so we can demo the full lifecycle:

---

**Replit Task: Verifier Approval → Admin Queue Handoff**

Please update `ui/viewer/index.html` to allow **Verifier approval** of Corrections/Blacklist items and move them into the **Admin queue** (artifact store + UI). This completes the handoff stage before admin processing.

**1) Status Transitions (Artifacts)**
- When Verifier clicks **Approve** on a **Correction** or **Blacklist** artifact:
  - Update artifact `status = "sent_to_admin"`
  - Append event `VERIFIER_APPROVED` to events.jsonl
- When Verifier clicks **Request Clarification**:
  - `status = "needs_clarification"`
  - Append event `VERIFIER_CLARIFICATION_REQUESTED`
- When Verifier clicks **Reject**:
  - `status = "rejected"`
  - Append event `VERIFIER_REJECTED`

**2) Admin Queue (UI + Filtering)**
- In **Admin view**, add a queue list for:
  - `status = sent_to_admin`
- Show the same payload fields as Verifier Review (field, old/new values, comment, etc.).
- This queue should be derived from artifact store (no UI state).

**3) Reviewer/Verifier Actions**
- Ensure **Approve** is only actionable for Correction/Blacklist.
- RFI should **not** send to admin (keep in verifier flow).
- If RFI is clicked, keep the actions limited to clarification/resolution.

**4) Routing**
- From Admin queue row click:
  - Open a **detail view** (can reuse Verifier Review layout for now, with an “Admin Review” label).

**Acceptance**
- Verifier approvals move items into Admin queue (status changes persisted).
- Admin queue renders from artifact store and survives refresh.
- RFI does not appear in Admin queue.
- Events log records approvals and clarifications.

Suggested commit: `ui(srr): verifier approval to admin queue`

Quick confirm so I match your intent:
1. **Should RFI ever move to Admin**, or should RFI stay in Verifier workflow only?  
   - Recommended: keep RFI in verifier only.

If you want a quick audit later, I’m happy to do it once you point me to the specific file(s) or paste the relevant diff.
