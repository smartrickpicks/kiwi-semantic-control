RIPLET TASK: Apply Kiwi Drift Corrections (Minimal Diff)

Goal:
Apply the three exact corrections from the Kiwi drift audit. Do NOT change anything else.

Files in scope (only these):
- docs/specs/Human-Agent-Workflow-V1.json
- docs/ui/gate_view_mapping.md
- docs/handoff/TASKS_UI.md

Patch 1 — Human-Agent-Workflow spec canonicalization
Update descriptions only (ids/labels already canonical in this repo):
- In data_source node description:
  "Load dataset (sample, CSV, or attached file)"
  → "Manage sources; load dataset (CSV/XLSX/JSON/PDF attachments)"
- In single_row_review node description:
  "Drill into individual records, examine field values"
  → "Per-record inspection; evidence; patch drafting (no state transitions)"
- In submit_patch_request node description:
  "Submit patch request for review"
  → "Submit Patch Request for review"

Patch 2 — gate_view_mapping owner token
- In docs/ui/gate_view_mapping.md, update:
  gate_parse owning view from data_source_view → data_source_panel

Patch 3 — replace TASKS_UI doc with exact template
Replace docs/handoff/TASKS_UI.md with the following exact content:

# TASKS_UI (Handoff — UI Backlog)

Audience: Governance reviewers and UI operators
Purpose: Track UI tasks with governance constraints and evidence links
Scope: UI copy and contracts only; no runtime or implementation claims
Non-Goals: No claims of completion without evidence (commit/PR URL)
Authority Level: Informational; defers to canonical docs
Owner Agent: Kiwi (documentation architect)
Update Rules: Each task must include scope, files likely to touch, and acceptance tests; if evidence missing, mark “Unknown — requires audit”

Repository: smartrickpicks/kiwi-semantic-control (branch: main)
Open PRs: unknown/none

## Backlog

### SRR: Field Order & Guard Modal (docs-only)
- Scope: Ensure Field Cards/Groups/Filters/Proposed Change/mini prompt/guard modal copy present in SRR doc
- Files likely to touch: docs/ui/views/single_row_review_view.md
- Acceptance: sections added; no runtime claims; Evidence link: Unknown — requires audit

### Data Source: Rotation/Disconnect copy parity
- Scope: Mirror rotation (Active→Saved) and Disconnect guidance in viewer copy
- Files likely to touch: docs/ui/views/data_source_view.md; ui/viewer/index.html
- Acceptance: copy present and consistent; Evidence link: Unknown — requires audit

### Spec/Mapping Canonicalization
- Scope: Update Human-Agent-Workflow-V1.json ids/labels/edges; gate_view_mapping owner token
- Files likely to touch: docs/specs/Human-Agent-Workflow-V1.json; docs/ui/gate_view_mapping.md
- Acceptance: spec uses data_source/single_row_review/submit_patch_request; gate_parse owner is data_source_panel; Evidence link: Unknown — requires audit

Output:
- Short diff summary
- Git add/commit commands
- Do not run Kiwi audit yet
