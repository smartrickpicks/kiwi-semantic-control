Replit Task: V1 Real Audit Log Timeline (Per File/Record) + Export Sheet Wiring

Alignment of task:
Gate doctrine work is complete; now make Audit Log fully real and deterministic so demo reviewers/admin can trace every action by file and role.

Repo targets:
- ui/viewer/index.html
- docs/AUDIT_LOG.md
- docs/ui/views/single_row_review_view.md
- docs/ui/views/verifier_review_view.md
- docs/ui/views/admin_approval_view.md

Scope:
1) Replace any placeholder/fake audit rows with event-backed timeline entries.
2) Persist audit events per dataset/file/record in IndexedDB (localStorage pointer only).
3) Ensure all core actions emit timeline events with actor + timestamp + ids.
4) Render per-file timeline in Audit Log UI and include in export workbook as a sheet.

Required event model (minimum fields):
- event_id
- event_type
- actor_id
- actor_role
- timestamp_iso
- dataset_id
- file_id (or file_name if no id)
- record_id
- field_key (nullable)
- patch_request_id (nullable)
- before_value (nullable)
- after_value (nullable)
- metadata (object)

Required event coverage:
- PATCH_SUBMITTED
- RFI_SUBMITTED
- PATCH_VERIFIER_TESTED
- PATCH_VERIFIER_PROMOTED
- PATCH_ADMIN_PROMOTED
- PATCH_REJECTED
- REQUEST_CLARIFICATION
- FIELD_VERIFIED
- FIELD_BLACKLISTED
- FIELD_CORRECTED
- MANUAL_ROW_ADD
- CATALOG_GROUP_SET / CATALOG_GROUP_UNSET
- SESSION_RESTORED
- SYSTEM_CHANGE_APPLIED (if auto-fix executes)

Rules:
- No synthetic “demo” events at render time.
- Timeline must be built only from persisted events.
- Sort strictly by timestamp ascending for history view, descending for latest-first list.
- If a legacy event shape is encountered, normalize it into this schema at read time.

UI behavior:
- Audit Log button in Record Inspection opens timeline scoped to current file.
- Optional filters: event_type, actor_role, patch_request_id.
- Clicking a timeline row navigates to related record when record_id exists.

Export behavior:
- Add `Audit_Log` sheet in exported workbook.
- Export exactly persisted events for the active dataset/file scope.
- Include deterministic columns in stable order matching schema.

Acceptance criteria:
- Running analyst->verifier->admin flow creates visible timeline entries for each step.
- Reload preserves timeline exactly (IndexedDB-backed).
- Export contains `Audit_Log` sheet with same events.
- No placeholder/static log rows appear.

Required output format:
1) Alignment of task
2) Event schema implemented
3) Files changed
4) Event coverage checklist
5) Smoke tests run
6) Remaining risks/deferred items
