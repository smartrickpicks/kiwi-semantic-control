Replit Task: SRR Handoff Fix + Minimal Record ID + External Alias Capture (Truth‑Config Compatible)

Scope: index.html only (local‑first, no backend).
Primary goal: Fix Reviewer/Verifier SRR hydration via shared PatchRequest store and deterministic routing (dataset_id + record_id + patch_request_id).
Secondary goal: Add minimal ID model: record_id (system) + aliases (external UUIDs) + division_id.

Requirements
Rename row_id → record_id
Use record_id everywhere for stable identity.
row_id should only exist as a source pointer (raw row index), not identity.
Record model must include
tenant_id
division_id
dataset_id
record_id
source_pointers (sheet_name, source_file_name, raw_row_index)
aliases[] (external IDs)
Generate record_id on import
If missing, compute:
record_id = hash(tenant_id + '|' + dataset_id + '|' + canonicalizeRowForFingerprint(row))
canonicalize = sorted keys + trimmed strings (stable stringification).
Capture external UUIDs as aliases
Regex:
^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[1-5][0-9a-f]{3}-[89ab][0-9a-f]{3}-[0-9a-f]{12}$
Store as:
aliases: [{ type: "uuid", value: "..." }]
Do not use alias as record_id.
PatchRequest and Queue use record_id
PatchRequest includes: tenant_id, division_id, dataset_id, record_id, patch_request_id, patch_kind, status, proposed_changes, evidence_pack, thread.
Queue items include: dataset_id, record_id, patch_request_id, division_id.
SRR hydration
Reviewer/Verifier/Admin SRR loads PatchRequest by patch_request_id first.
If missing → blocking error UI with exact storage key.
Then load record by dataset_id + record_id.
Render read‑only Row Inspector from record + Patch Inspector/evidence/thread from PatchRequest.
Debug panel
When ?debug=1, show:
role, tenant_id, division_id, dataset_id, record_id, patch_request_id
computed storage keys + load success
Acceptance Tests
Analyst submits patch → reviewer queue item contains dataset_id + record_id + patch_request_id.
Reviewer opens → SRR shows proposed_changes/evidence/thread every time.
Sorting/filtering does not break record mapping.
UUID‑like field appears in aliases[] (visible in debug panel).
