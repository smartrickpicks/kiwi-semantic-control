Totally aligned — we’ll treat Drive as the **future source**, but we can make the **loader UI + first‑time folder mapping** behave like a real workflow right now. Here’s a single Replit prompt to implement exactly what you described.

---

**Replit Task: Data Source Modal + First‑Time Folder Mapping (Local‑First, Drive‑Ready)**

**Goal**  
Make the Data Source flow feel real for first‑time users, even before Google Drive integration. Remove test data, disable search, and make the modal reflect a mapped “Ingestion Folder.”

---

## 1) First‑Time User Flow (Modal)
**Requirement:** On first sign‑in (no folder mapped), show a modal:

- Title: “Select Your Ingestion Folder”  
- Explanation: “Choose your assigned data source folder to load datasets from.”  
- Folder picker is **mocked for now**:
  - dropdown list of 3–5 folders, one per analyst name  
- Save selection to localStorage (e.g., `ingestion_folder_name`)  
- After selection, Data Source modal shows **Active Dataset** as “Connected to: [Folder Name]”

**Acceptance:** First‑time users must select a folder before proceeding.

---

## 2) Data Source Modal Updates
**Remove / disable UI that conflicts with folder‑based workflow:**

- Remove **Upload New** and **Connect Source** blocks  
- Disable Search input (show “Coming soon” + placeholder; don’t allow typing)  
- Update “Active Dataset” card to show:
  - “Connected: [Folder Name]”
  - Last sync time (use local time for now)

---

## 3) Saved Datasets = Local Cache
Saved datasets should only show **locally cached / previously worked files**.

- Remove hardcoded demo datasets (Ostereo test, Sample Dataset, etc.)  
- If nothing cached, show empty state:
  - “No cached datasets yet. Work on a file to save it here.”

---

## 4) Remove Fake Data
- Clear triage fake data in Analyst view  
- Remove any hard‑coded test entries from the queue/state

---

## 5) Controls
Add a **“Change Folder”** button in Data Source modal:

- Re‑open the folder selection modal  
- Update folder name in localStorage

---

**Suggested commit**  
`ui(data): folder-mapped data source + remove demo datasets`

---

If you want, after this we can add a **stub “Sync from Drive”** button (disabled) so it’s clear the next step is real Drive integration once keys arrive.
