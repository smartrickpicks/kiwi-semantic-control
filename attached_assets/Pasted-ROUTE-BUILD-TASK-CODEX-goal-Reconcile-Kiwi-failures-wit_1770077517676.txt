ROUTE: BUILD_TASK_CODEX
goal: Reconcile Kiwi failures with actual repo state and route the required docs-only fixes to Replit.
files_in_scope:
- `docs/specs/Human-Agent-Workflow-V1.json`
- `docs/ui/gate_view_mapping.md`
- `docs/handoff/TASKS_UI.md`
constraints:
- No invented state.
- Use canonical terminology only.

Quick reality check from the repo right now:
- `docs/handoff/TASKS_UI.md` **exists** and contains the UI backlog.
- `docs/specs/Human-Agent-Workflow-V1.json` **still contains** legacy ids/labels (`load_data`, `record_inspection`, `submit_queue`).
- `docs/ui/gate_view_mapping.md` **still uses** `load_data` for `gate_parse`.

So Replit’s “already fixed” report does **not** match the current repo state. We should run a docs-only patch to apply Kiwi’s minimal diffs.

Here is the Replit task you can run:

```json
{
  "route": "BUILD_TASK_REPLIT",
  "goal": "Apply Kiwi minimal diffs: canonicalize Human-Agent-Workflow-V1.json and update gate_parse owner token. (TASKS_UI already exists; do not overwrite unless missing.)",
  "constraints": [
    "Docs-only changes.",
    "Use canonical terminology only (Data Source, Single Row Review, Submit Patch Request).",
    "Do not claim pushes/PRs/merges without URLs."
  ],
  "files_in_scope": [
    "docs/specs/Human-Agent-Workflow-V1.json",
    "docs/ui/gate_view_mapping.md"
  ],
  "implementation_steps": [
    {
      "id": "SPEC-01",
      "title": "Canonicalize spec nodes/edges",
      "requirements": [
        "load_data -> data_source (label: Data Source)",
        "record_inspection -> single_row_review (label: Single Row Review)",
        "submit_queue -> submit_patch_request (label: Submit Patch Request)",
        "Update all edges to use new ids"
      ],
      "acceptance_tests": [
        "No legacy ids/labels remain in Human-Agent-Workflow-V1.json"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "MAP-01",
      "title": "Update gate_parse owning view",
      "requirements": [
        "Replace gate_parse owner 'load_data' with 'data_source_view'"
      ],
      "acceptance_tests": [
        "gate_parse row shows data_source_view"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "output_format": {
    "summary": "bullet list of file changes",
    "verification": "manual checks or grep notes",
    "suggested_commit_message": "one line",
    "git_commands": "exact add/commit commands without claiming push"
  }
}
```

When you run that and send the diff summary, I’ll verify it against the acceptance tests and then we can queue the UI‑01 Single Row Review build.
