ROUTE: BUILD_TASK_REPLIT
goal: Implement P0-01 — SRR PDF viewer rendering + navigation (read-only) in the static viewer, replacing the current SRR PDF stub.
constraints:
- Offline-first; no network calls.
- Do not add new primary views; SRR only.
- SRR remains read-only for Review State (badge display only).
- Keep canonical tokens unchanged; UI label may remain “Record Inspection”.
- Use local artifacts only (prefer PDF attachments already stored locally by the viewer).
files_in_scope:
- `ui/viewer/index.html`
- `docs/ui/views/single_row_review_view.md`
implementation_steps:
1. Render PDF in SRR (read-only)
- Requirements:
  - Replace the SRR “PDF viewer stub” with an actual in-page PDF renderer.
  - Source should be local-only: render from the viewer’s attached PDF artifacts (existing attachment mechanism) and/or a repository-local PDF path if already supported.
  - If no PDF is available for the record, show a clear empty state (no errors, no network).
- Acceptance tests:
  - When a PDF is attached, SRR displays the PDF content (not just placeholder text).
  - When no PDF is attached, SRR shows an empty state explaining how to attach via Data Source.

2. Navigation + zoom controls
- Requirements:
  - Add Prev/Next page controls and page indicator (e.g., “Page X / Y”).
  - Add zoom in/out controls with deterministic limits (e.g., min/max).
  - Keep the viewer read-only (no annotations, no edits).
- Acceptance tests:
  - Prev/Next changes the rendered page.
  - Zoom in/out works and respects limits.
  - No edit/annotation controls are present.

3. Persistence (session/local)
- Requirements:
  - Persist per-record viewer state in session/local storage (last page + zoom) keyed deterministically (e.g., by join identity).
- Acceptance tests:
  - Leaving SRR and returning restores last page/zoom for that record within the same session.

4. Docs alignment
- Requirements:
  - Update `docs/ui/views/single_row_review_view.md` PDF viewer section to reflect actual behavior (rendering + controls + empty state).
- Acceptance tests:
  - Doc describes the implemented PDF behavior without claiming network/runtime integrations.
