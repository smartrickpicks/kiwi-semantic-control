# CHANGELOG

## Version: v2.53
Date: 2026-02-14

### Added (Suggested Fields — P2 Cleanup + P1 Features)

- SUGGEST-24: Renamed "Sync" tab → "Suggestions" in grid float controls; "Reject" button → "Decline" in suggestion action buttons. Internal API status value remains `rejected`; this is a presentation-layer change only.

- SUGGEST-22: Migration 009 adds `version` (integer, default 1) and `updated_at` (timestamptz, default now()) to `glossary_aliases` table. Enables optimistic-concurrency on alias edits.

- SUGGEST-23: `PATCH /glossary/aliases/{id}` endpoint with version-based OCC. Duplicate normalized-alias detection returns 409. Emits `glossary_alias.updated` audit event with before/after payload.

- SUGGEST-09/10: OpenAPI documentation (docs/api/openapi.yaml) updated with full Suggested Fields tag, including glossary/terms, glossary/aliases, suggestions/run, and suggestions endpoints with request/response schemas.

- SUGGEST-11: Frontend workspace context via `_syncHeaders()` — all suggestion/glossary API calls include `X-Workspace-Id` header. Source: JWT claim → localStorage session → seed workspace fallback.

- Module Registry (P1D16): `Engines.SuggestionsState` and `Components.SuggestionsPanel` registered in AppModules with delegating accessors to `_syncState`, toggle, run, accept, decline, and refresh operations.

- Section Metadata Integration: `orderFieldsForInspector()` now reads `enrichments.section_metadata` from `field_meta.json`. When section_headers + field_section_map are present for a sheet, fields are grouped by section with question_order ordering. Falls back to legacy hinge-based grouping when metadata is absent.

- Section Focus Guidance: `renderSectionGuidanceCard()` reads `section_focus` from section_metadata before falling back to `config/section_guidance.json`. Preserves existing guidance card UI shell (what_to_look_for, common_failure_modes).

- Glossary Definition Surfaces: `buildGlossaryPortalContent()` now shows "No definition available for this field." when `fields[].definition` is empty/missing. Preserves requiredness, type, picklist, and hinge group tags.

### Verified (Alias Workflow Alignment)
- Alias accept path confirmed idempotent (duplicate returns 409 with existing mapping)
- Audit emission confirmed on create (`glossary_alias.created`) and update (`glossary_alias.updated`)
- Workspace isolation confirmed via `_require_workspace_id()` on all glossary endpoints
- Suggestion naming consistent: UI "Decline" / display "declined" / API status "rejected"
- Non-suggestion rejection semantics (patch/system flows) unchanged

---

## Version: v0.1.0
Date: 2026-01-29

### Added
- Semantic Control Board governance documents (SCOPE_control_plane.md, CONTROL_BOARD_ARCHITECTURE.md, RULE_LIFECYCLE.md, INTERFACES.md, TRUTH_SNAPSHOT.md, CONFLICT_RESOLUTION.md, REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md, examples/README.md)
  - Why: Establish a single, auditable source of semantic truth and clear operating boundaries.
- Canonical join strategy (contract_key → file_url → file_name)
  - Why: Ensure deterministic linking across stages and prevent silent data drift.
- Determinism guarantee for previews (offline only)
  - Why: Make outcomes reproducible and reviewable without runtime dependencies or network calls.
- Operator-first index and templates (INDEX.md, rule templates, config templates)
  - Why: Streamline authoring and review, reduce ambiguity, and support consistent change control.

### Changed
- Consolidated repository as a governance-only control plane (no runtime code, no APIs, no credentials)
  - Why: Maintain a stable, reviewable semantic authority separate from execution environments.
- Local preview harness: join-triplet grouping fix (contract_key → file_url → file_name) for status aggregation and issue/action attribution
  - Why: Prevent mis-aggregation when contract_key is missing; ensure consistency across all joins.
- Local preview harness: join-failure diagnostic (blocking) when a THEN targets a missing target row (e.g., catalog)
  - Why: Surface unsafe application of rules and force BLOCKED status deterministically.
- Validator: strict base_version enforcement for patches (patch.base_version must equal base.version)
  - Why: Prevent drift and ensure patches apply to the intended base semantics.

### Deprecated
- None in this initial version
  - Why: First release of governance materials; no prior artifacts to deprecate.

---

## Version: v0.1.1
Date: 2026-01-29

### Added
- docs/07_replit_mcp.md and scripts/mcp_link_gen.py (deterministic ENCODED/LINK/BADGE_MARKDOWN output)
  - Why: Enable safe, reproducible MCP setup in Replit without secrets.
- scripts/replit_smoke.sh strict diff gate (with `--allow-diff` override)
  - Why: Provide a clear pass/fail operator signal and reproducible verification.

### Changed
- README.md and docs/INDEX.md updated to include Replit MCP and smoke flow
  - Why: Improve discoverability and reduce operator onboarding time.

### Verification
- Replit golden run verified — see docs/replit_baseline.md (records date/time, environment, and SHA256 of out/sf_packet.preview.json).

### Deprecated
- None
  - Why: Non-breaking governance-surface enhancements only.

---

## Version: v0.1.2
Date: 2026-01-30

### Changed
- Determinism hardening in preview outputs: explicit array sorting by join triplet (contract_key → file_url → file_name) and normalized key ordering for diffing.
  - Why: Eliminate incidental ordering diffs; ensure stable, audit-friendly previews.
- Documentation updates:
  - TRUTH_SNAPSHOT: clarified authoritative vs illustrative files and config-driven semantics.
  - replit_baseline: added narrative of determinism fix and authority of smoke tests over editor diagnostics.

### Notes
- No semantic rule changes. Configuration meaning is unchanged; this release only enforces ordering/normalization for deterministic previews.

### Required Operator Action
- Treat v0.1.2 as the locked baseline. Future changes require a version bump and strict smoke pass (baseline and, when applicable, edge-case packs).

---

## Version: v0.1.3 (DRAFT)
Date: 2026-01-30

### Added
- Patch: config/config_pack.v0.1.3.patch.json (SF_R2_ARTIST_REQUIRES_ARTIST_NAME — warning completeness rule)

### Changed
- examples/expected_outputs/sf_packet.example.json updated to reflect new rule (artist row Needs Review)

### Why
- Low-risk, demonstrable rule aligned with subtype expectations. Determinism unaffected.

### Smoke Evidence
- Baseline smoke should pass with updated expected output.

---

## Meta: Product Rename (2026-01-30)
- Changed: Product name to “Orchestrate OS.”
- Why: Unify naming; semantics unchanged. Historical aliases (Kiwi, Control Board, Kiwi Semantic Control Board) remain as searchable references.
