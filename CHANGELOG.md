### Added
- Viewer v0.9 Session + Stream Model (Conceptual Bridge)
  - Session Timeline Panel: Models ordered sessions (ingest waves) as UI-only JSON
  - Record State Model: CONSOLIDATED | PARTIAL | WAITING | BLOCKED derived from issues
  - Never-Stop Flow Visualization: Explains open faucet concept for continuous processing
  - Reconsolidation Rules Table: Shows how partial records upgrade to consolidated
  - Copy Stream Semantics Markdown: One-click PR-ready explanation export
  - Why: Lay semantic groundwork for future streaming without runtime execution.
- docs/14_stream_semantics.md: Governance-only explanation of stream model

### Technical Details
- Record state derived deterministically from issue severity and type
- Session simulation based on loaded artifact data
- All computations performed offline in the browser
- No actual streaming, async processing, or runtime changes

---

## Version: v0.8.0
Date: 2026-01-30

### Added
- Viewer v0.8 Config + Patch Inspector (Ruleset Delta Viewer)
  - Ruleset Loader Panel: Collapsible UI to load base config + patch files
  - Patch Summary: Displays base.version, patch.base_version, author, rationale, changes_count
  - Version Match Chip: RED mismatch indicator when base_version differs
  - Changes[] Table: Deterministic table of patch changes with action, target, rule_id, when, then, severity
  - Ruleset Delta Counts: Added/Deprecated counts per target (salesforce/qa/resolver)
  - Copy Ruleset Delta Markdown: One-click export of PR-ready semantic delta description
  - Preflight Integration: Loaded config versions auto-populate Preflight Base Version Check
  - Why: Enable operators to inspect semantic ruleset changes before submitting PRs.

### Technical Details
- Deterministic change sorting: target asc, action asc, rule_id asc (nulls last), when.sheet, when.field, severity order, then fields
- All computations performed offline in the browser, no network requests
- Base + patch loaded via relative paths, no file uploads

---

## Version: v0.7.0
Date: 2026-01-30

### Added
- Viewer v0.7 Comparison Mode
  - Session Loader UI: Collapsible panel with primary and comparison artifact path inputs
  - Delta Summary Cards: Visual display of contract status changes and row-level deltas
  - Row Change Indicators: Green (added), orange (changed), red strikethrough (removed) for tables
  - Copy Delta Summary button: Export delta statistics as Markdown
  - Why: Enable operators to analyze semantic changes between artifact versions without external tools.

### Technical Details
- Join identity for change detection: `contract_key|file_url|file_name` (extended for issues/actions)
- Content hash using JSON.stringify with sorted keys for deterministic comparison
- All delta computations performed offline in the browser, no network requests

---

## Version: v0.1.0
Date: 2026-01-29

### Added
- Semantic Control Board governance documents (SCOPE_control_plane.md, CONTROL_BOARD_ARCHITECTURE.md, RULE_LIFECYCLE.md, INTERFACES.md, TRUTH_SNAPSHOT.md, CONFLICT_RESOLUTION.md, REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md, examples/README.md)
  - Why: Establish a single, auditable source of semantic truth and clear operating boundaries.
- Canonical join strategy (contract_key → file_url → file_name)
  - Why: Ensure deterministic linking across stages and prevent silent data drift.
- Determinism guarantee for previews (offline only)
  - Why: Make outcomes reproducible and reviewable without runtime dependencies or network calls.
- Operator-first index and templates (INDEX.md, rule templates, config templates)
  - Why: Streamline authoring and review, reduce ambiguity, and support consistent change control.

### Changed
- Consolidated repository as a governance-only control plane (no runtime code, no APIs, no credentials)
  - Why: Maintain a stable, reviewable semantic authority separate from execution environments.
- Local preview harness: join-triplet grouping fix (contract_key → file_url → file_name) for status aggregation and issue/action attribution
  - Why: Prevent mis-aggregation when contract_key is missing; ensure consistency across all joins.
- Local preview harness: join-failure diagnostic (blocking) when a THEN targets a missing target row (e.g., catalog)
  - Why: Surface unsafe application of rules and force BLOCKED status deterministically.
- Validator: strict base_version enforcement for patches (patch.base_version must equal base.version)
  - Why: Prevent drift and ensure patches apply to the intended base semantics.

### Deprecated
- None in this initial version
  - Why: First release of governance materials; no prior artifacts to deprecate.

---

## Version: v0.1.1
Date: 2026-01-29

### Added
- docs/07_replit_mcp.md and scripts/mcp_link_gen.py (deterministic ENCODED/LINK/BADGE_MARKDOWN output)
  - Why: Enable safe, reproducible MCP setup in Replit without secrets.
- scripts/replit_smoke.sh strict diff gate (with `--allow-diff` override)
  - Why: Provide a clear pass/fail operator signal and reproducible verification.

### Changed
- README.md and docs/INDEX.md updated to include Replit MCP and smoke flow
  - Why: Improve discoverability and reduce operator onboarding time.

### Verification
- Replit golden run verified — see docs/replit_baseline.md (records date/time, environment, and SHA256 of out/sf_packet.preview.json).

### Deprecated
- None
  - Why: Non-breaking governance-surface enhancements only.

---

## Version: v0.1.2
Date: 2026-01-30

### Changed
- Local preview harness: deterministic output ordering fix
  - Why: Ensure entries with contract_key sort before entries without, providing consistent array ordering across sf_contract_results, sf_field_actions, sf_issues, and sf_change_log.
  - Impact: Smoke test now passes with strict diff comparison.

### Verification
- Replit golden run verified — see docs/replit_baseline.md
  - Python 3.12.12, Linux-6.14.11-x86_64-with-glibc2.40
  - out/sf_packet.preview.json SHA256: bea0af0e24f3994b80ac84bfdf6aaa4241b18ed045c0d1ef691bee8c55679452
  - examples/expected_outputs/sf_packet.example.json SHA256: f37d2dfe25829da2064b63c1012bb51d31f52ec7672098d20c8943d9dc2c8105

### Deprecated
- None
  - Why: Bug fix only; no semantic changes.
