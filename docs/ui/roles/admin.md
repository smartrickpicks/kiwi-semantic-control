## REVIEW_CHECKLIST Requirements

Before Admin Approve, the Admin must confirm all checklist sections (see [REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md](../../REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md)):

| Section | Required for Approval |
|---------|----------------------|
| Intent Clarity | Yes |
| Schema Correctness | Yes |
| Preview Validity | Yes |
| Conflict Assessment | Yes |
| Downstream Risk Awareness | Yes |
| Smoke Verification | Yes (must be passing) |

**If evidence is missing:** The Admin must use "Admin Hold" to block the patch. Promotion without complete evidence and passing smoke test is a contract violation.

## Audit Requirements

Actions that must be logged:
- Admin Approve (timestamp, patch_id, admin_actor, notes)
- Admin Hold (timestamp, patch_id, admin_actor, hold_reason)
- Release Hold (timestamp, patch_id, admin_actor)
- Promote Patch to Baseline (timestamp, patch_id, admin_actor, baseline_version)
- Export to PR (timestamp, patch_id, admin_actor, export_path)
