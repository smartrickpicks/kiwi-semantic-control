# Load Data View — DEPRECATED

> **Superseded by [Data Source View](data_source_view.md).**

This document is deprecated as of v1.4.5. The "Load Data" modal has been replaced by the **Data Source** right-side panel accessed via the top quick-action bar.

See [data_source_view.md](data_source_view.md) for the current governed Data Source experience.

## Migration Notes
- **Entry point**: Top quick-action "Data Source" button (no sidebar nav item).
- **Panel type**: Right-side drawer (not modal).
- **Layout**: Active Dataset card → Upload|Connect row → Search stub → Saved Datasets.
- **File support**: CSV and XLSX with multi-sheet workbook support.
- **Terminology**: "Data Source" (not "Load Data"), "Review States" (not "Queues").
