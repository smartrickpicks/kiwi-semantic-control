## UI Components

### Left Panel: Field Inspector

1. **Search Bar**
   - Input field filters by field name or value
   - Real-time filtering as user types

2. **Filter Chips**
   - All: Show all fields
   - Changed: Show only locked/committed fields
   - Unchanged: Show fields not yet modified

3. **Field Cards**
   - Display field name (human-friendly label)
   - Display current value (click to edit)
   - Chips: Changed (green), Locked (🔒), Required
   - Locked fields cannot be edited inline (use Patch Editor)

### Right Panel: Patch Editor

1. **Changed Fields Section**
   - Shows count of changes
   - Per-field blocks with:
     - Field label + remove button
     - Old value (locked, dimmed, strikethrough style)
     - New value (editable input)
   - Editing new value syncs to Field Inspector display

2. **Evidence Pack**
   - **Observation (WHEN)**: Dropdown + optional notes
     - Options: Incorrect Value, Missing Value, Formatting Issue, Duplicate Entry, Inconsistent Data, Other
   - **Expected (THEN)**: Dropdown + optional notes
     - Options: Use Correct Value, Populate Empty Field, Standardize Format, Remove Duplicate, Align with Source Document, Other
   - **Justification (BECAUSE)**: Textarea
   - **Repro**: Dropdown + optional notes + file input
     - Options: Visual Inspection of Document, Data Comparison, Rule Violation Detected, Verified Against External Source, Other

3. **Actions**
   - Save Draft: Persists evidence pack to local state
   - Submit Patch Request: Validates and creates patch request

## Workflow

1. **Load Record**: Navigate to a row in the grid, opens SRR
2. **Search/Filter**: Use search input or filter chips to find fields
3. **Edit Field**: Click field value to enter edit mode
4. **Commit Edit**: Press Enter or blur to commit; field locks
5. **Review in Patch Editor**: Changed fields appear in right panel
6. **Modify New Value**: Edit in Patch Editor if needed (syncs back)
7. **Fill Evidence Pack**: Select dropdowns, add notes/justification
8. **Submit**: Click Submit Patch Request

## Validation Rules

- **Observation type**: Required (must select from dropdown)
- **Expected type**: Required (must select from dropdown)
- **At least one change**: Required (must have committed field edits)
- **Justification**: Optional but recommended

## State Management

```javascript
srrState = {
  originalValues: {},      // Snapshot of record values on load
  editedValues: {},        // Current edited values
  proposedChanges: {},     // Change objects per field
  lockedFields: {},        // Fields locked after commit
  searchQuery: '',         // Current search filter
  activeFilter: 'all',     // all | changed | unchanged
  patchDraft: {
    observation_type: '',
    observation_notes: '',
    expected_type: '',
    expected_notes: '',
    justification: '',
    repro_type: '',
    repro_notes: '',
    repro_file: null,
    changes: [],
    status: 'Draft'
  }
}
```

## Patch Request Creation

When submitted, creates a `PatchRequest` with:
- `record_identity`: contract_key, file_url, file_name
- `target_scope`: sheet, field (or "multiple" if >1 field changed)
- `intent_structured`: condition_type=FIELD_VALUE, action_type=SET_VALUE
- `evidence`: Observation, Expected, Justification, Repro blocks
- `proposed_change`: Summary of old → new values

The request is added to `patchRequestsStore` and appears in Patch Console.

## Non-Goals

- No PDF parsing or auto-extraction
- No backend sync (demo/offline only)
- No system auto-rules
- No multi-user collaboration
