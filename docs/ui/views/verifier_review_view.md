## Gate Ownership

This view owns one gate (see [gate_view_mapping.md](../gate_view_mapping.md)):

| Gate | Condition | On Failure |
|------|-----------|------------|
| gate_verifier | Verifier decision recorded | Patch remains in Under_Review |

## REVIEW_CHECKLIST Enforcement

Before approving, the Verifier must satisfy these checklist sections (see [REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md](../../REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md)):

| Section | Check |
|---------|-------|
| Intent Clarity | Plain-English description, rule_id naming, scope boundaries |
| Schema Correctness | Canonical names, valid operators, required attributes |
| Preview Validity | Repository examples, deterministic, understandable |
| Conflict Assessment | No contradictions, consistent severity, overlaps resolved |
| Downstream Risk Awareness | Workflow impact, migration notes, interactions |
| Smoke Verification | Strict pass with evidence |

**Contract:** If any checklist item cannot be verified due to missing evidence, the Verifier MUST use "Request Clarification". Approving without complete evidence is a contract violation.

## Audit/Evidence Requirements

| Event | Logged | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Begin Review | Yes | timestamp, patch_id, verifier_actor |
| Request Clarification | Yes | timestamp, patch_id, question_text |
| Approve (Verifier) | Yes | timestamp, patch_id, verifier_actor, checklist_confirmed |
| Reject | Yes | timestamp, patch_id, verifier_actor, rejection_reason |

## State Transitions
