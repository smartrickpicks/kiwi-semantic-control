# TASKS_UI (Handoff — UI Backlog)

<!--
Audience: Governance reviewers and UI operators
Purpose: Track UI tasks with governance constraints and evidence links
Scope: UI copy and contracts only; no runtime or implementation claims
Non-Goals: No claims of completion without evidence (commit/PR URL)
Authority Level: Informational; defers to canonical docs
Owner Agent: Kiwi (documentation architect)
Update Rules: Each task must include scope, files likely to touch, and acceptance criteria
-->

|----|------|-------|----------------------|---------------------|--------|
| SRR-BUG-01 | BUGFIX: SRR row open uses active sheet selection (currentSheetFilter error) | UI bugfix | `ui/viewer/index.html` | No ReferenceError on row click; SRR_OPEN log shows sheetName != "unknown" | Done (9c4bfda) |

| EP-REPLAY-01 | Admin Approval: Patch Replay Gate panel with status badge and Run Replay button | UI | `ui/viewer/index.html`, `docs/ui/views/admin_approval_view.md` | Admin Approval shows Patch Replay section; Run Replay sets deterministic PASS/FAIL | In Progress |
