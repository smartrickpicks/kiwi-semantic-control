# TASKS_UI (Handoff — UI Backlog)

Audience: Governance reviewers and UI operators
Purpose: Track UI tasks with governance constraints and evidence links
Scope: UI copy and contracts only; no runtime or implementation claims
Non-Goals: No claims of completion without evidence (commit/PR URL)
Authority Level: Informational; defers to canonical docs
Owner Agent: Kiwi (documentation architect)
Update Rules: Each task must include scope, files likely to touch, and acceptance tests; if evidence missing, mark "Unknown — requires audit"

Repository: smartrickpicks/kiwi-semantic-control (branch: main)
Open PRs: unknown/none
