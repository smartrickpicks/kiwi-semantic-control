# TASKS_UI (Handoff — UI Backlog)

<!--
Audience: Governance reviewers and UI operators
Purpose: Track UI tasks with governance constraints and evidence links
Scope: UI copy and contracts only; no runtime or implementation claims
Non-Goals: No claims of completion without evidence (commit/PR URL)
Authority Level: Informational; defers to canonical docs
Owner Agent: Kiwi (documentation architect)
Update Rules: Each task must include scope, files likely to touch, and acceptance criteria
-->
