# SCOPE_control_plane.md

## Purpose

The Semantic Control Board (Orchestrate OS) is a standalone control plane for authoring, validating, and governing semantic rules used in downstream systems. It captures human judgment about meaning, intent, and edge cases, then translates that judgment into deterministic, reviewable configuration artifacts.

This system exists to make semantic decisions explicit, stable, and auditable.

## Integration Posture (V1)
Orchestrate OS is governance-first and does not directly connect to or mutate external systems. External data may be brought into Oorchestrate OS via mediated labys (e.g., Kiwi) and/or offline exports (e.g., Salesforce Sandbox exports). Any connectivity happens outside the governance plane; no credentials or secrets are stored inside the governance plane.

## Intended Users
- Operators: Perform reviews, identify patterns, and author rules.
- Analysts: Validate semantic consistency and downstream impact.
- Verifiers: Approve, reject, or request changes to rule patches.
- Admin: Governs configuration conventions, determinism policy, baseline and versioning discipline; approves/exports governed patches.

## Inputs
- Standardized datasets (post-normalization, example-based)
- QA artifacts (observed errors, edge cases, inconsistencies)
- Salesforce-like field expectations (conceptual, not API-bound)
- Existing config_pack base files

## Outputs
- Deterministic semantic rules
- config_pack patch files
- Offline preview classifications
- Human-readable documentation and changelogs

## Integration Posture (UP-F1)
- No direct connectors or mutating actions within the control plane.
- External data ingestion may occur via mediated layers (e.g., Kiwi) and/or offline exports (e.g., Salesforce Sandbox).
- The governance plane does not store credentials/secrets; any connectivity occurs outside (therefore mendiated).

## Explicit Non-Goals (preserved)
- No embedded runtime execution within the control plane.
- No LLM prompts hosted or models connected to control plane flows.
- Offline-first, strict determinism constraints.
