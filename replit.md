# Orchestrate OS — Semantic Control Board

## Overview
Orchestrate OS is a governance-only semantic control plane designed to define, validate, and preview semantic rules offline. It serves as a single source of semantic truth, enabling rule authoring and review as configuration. The project aims to improve operator ergonomics, streamline the patch request and review pipeline, and provide an analyst-first reference for explicit, deterministic, and auditable decisions. It captures semantic decisions as reviewable configuration artifacts and operates offline-first, ensuring deterministic outputs using only the Python standard library for local previews.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture
The core design principle involves capturing semantic decisions as reviewable configuration artifacts. The system uses a canonical join strategy for data handling and a Config Pack Model with strict version matching. It supports an 11-status lifecycle for patch requests, including comment systems and role-based access control (Analyst, Verifier, Admin, Architect).

The UI features a dashboard with a queue-centric sidebar, right-side drawers for data sources and record details, and role-based navigation. Admin configurations are presented in a workflow-ordered view. A Patch Studio facilitates drafting, preflight checks, and evidence packing with live previews and revision tracking. UI elements include color-coded grid highlighting, Excel-style column headers, and a PDF viewer. Record Inspection (SRR) provides navigation.

Data handling supports CSV/XLSX import, a Field Inspector for search-filtered fields, inline editing, and a lock-on-commit mechanism. A change map engine tracks cell-level changes. The Verifier Triage employs a 4-queue system, and a localStorage-backed mock filesystem manages artifacts. Workbook session caching persists uploaded Excel data to IndexedDB, supporting multi-session storage and auto-save.

Triage Analytics schema matching uses normalized key comparison (`_normKey`: lowercase + collapse non-alphanumeric to underscore) and `COLUMN_ALIAS_MAP` resolution to match workbook headers against `field_meta.json` canonical keys, boosting match rates from ~8% to ~37% on typical Salesforce-style workbooks.

Semantic rules generate deterministic cell-level signals on dataset load using `field_meta.json` and `qa_flags.json` for validation, populating Analyst Triage queues and driving grid coloring. Rules follow a WHEN/THEN pattern. Record identity is defined by `tenant_id`, `division_id`, `dataset_id`, `record_id`. The system uses email-based access control with Google sign-in for production OAuth.

Features include "Catalog Items Group" for batch adding and deduplication. Each record includes a `_document_type` and `_capabilities` object, with document types loaded from `config/document_types.json`. Export functionality generates XLSX files including all data sheets, change logs, signals summaries, and metadata. An Audit Timeline system uses an IndexedDB-backed store for all governance actions, accessible via a UI with filtering options and exportable to XLSX.

The system incorporates a Schema Tree Editor for managing the canonical rules bundle, including `field_meta.json`, `hinge_groups.json`, `sheet_order.json`, `qa_flags.json`, `document_types.json`, and `column_aliases.json`. It supports column alias resolution and tracking of schema changes. A Batch Merge feature allows combining source batches into a single governance container, with explicit rule promotion for tenant rules.

Document roles are inferred with user confirmation. A `SystemPass` module provides a deterministic, rerunnable, proposal-only engine for system changes, routed to a "System Changes" triage bucket. Pre-Flight triage buckets handle blockers like unknown columns or unreadable OCR. A Contract Index Engine builds a hierarchy of batch→contract→document→sheet→row, persisting summary references to SessionDB.

The `SystemPass.acceptProposal()` for hinge-field proposals auto-creates a `system_suggested` patch artifact and routes it through the standard patch lifecycle. `UndoManager` provides local, session-scoped undo for draft-only SRR inline edits. `RollbackEngine` creates governed rollback artifacts at 4 scopes (field, patch, contract, batch), capturing before/after state snapshots and triggering reruns if hinge-field modifications are detected. Audit events are generated for all these actions.

The Triage Analytics module aggregates metrics from various stores into a lightweight cache, rendering above the triage grid with 3-lane cards (Pre-Flight, Semantic, Patch Review), a horizontal lifecycle tracker, and a contract summary drilldown table. Triage Telemetry provides live pipeline telemetry with processing status banners, lifecycle deltas, and derived contract state chips. Record Inspector Guidance provides section-specific advice and knowledge links.

Contract ID derivation enforces priority (extracted path ID → hash(canonical URL) → fallback signature). ContractIndex is always rebuilt from the workbook on all load paths. Unknown column routing uses sheet-scoped frequency voting for contract attachment with severity thresholds. Header-echo rows are removed at parse time. Sandbox mode is permissionless; Production uses strict role gates. A Pre-Flight Calibration Suite ensures the accuracy of pre-flight detectors. A TruthPack module with an `architect` role enables a clean-room state machine for calibration and baseline marking. A Role Registry with stable role IDs (`architect`, `admin`, `verifier`, `analyst`), permission-based access checks, and a People workspace (Members/Roles/Invites) are integrated. Truth Config versioning stores baselines in SessionDB with a test_mode/established lifecycle and rollback capability. An Invite system provides single-use invite creation, use, and revocation with audit events.

The system routes to triage by default for all roles. Contract-first navigation is implemented in the All Data Grid. A legacy double-slash annotation sanitizer cleans URL and business fields during XLSX and CSV parsing. Pre-Flight items now include sheet-specific tabs and show more human-readable labels for blockers.

A FastAPI server acts as a local PDF proxy for CORS-safe PDF fetching and text extraction using PyMuPDF. SheetJS (XLSX) is loaded via CDN for Excel import/export functionality.
### P1C Contract Composite Grid (v2.3.5)
Applied via `scripts/p1c_delta.py` (4 edits: E1-CSS, E2-controls HTML, E3-composite detect, E4-helpers). When a specific contract is selected and Sheet = All Sheets, the All Data Grid replaces the flat table with nested, collapsible sheet sections. (A) Trigger: `_activeContractFilter != ''` AND `gridState.sheet == null/''`. (B) Each section: sheet header with name + row count + status mini-chips (Ready/Review/Blocked), expand/collapse toggle, independent horizontal scroll, sticky column headers, per-sheet column detection. (C) "Expand All / Collapse All" controls (`#p1c-composite-controls`). (D) Search/status filters apply across all sections; empty sections omitted; clear empty-state message when no rows match. (E) Row clicks route to SRR via `openRowReviewDrawer(sheet, idx)`. (F) Footer shows total rows + composite sheet count. (G) Mode cleanup: when sheet is selected or contract cleared, composite root is removed, original table re-shown. (H) Deterministic logs: `[GRID-COMPOSITE][P1C] mode_enabled`, `section_rendered`, `section_toggled`, `mode_disabled`. (I) ES5 compliant. Runtime attestation: P1C GREEN (25/25), regressions GREEN (P0.2.2:13/13, P1:10/10, Cal:8/8, P0.8:10/10, P0.9:10/10, P1A:12/12).

### P1F Batch PDF Scan (v2.3.5)
Applied via `scripts/p1f_delta.py` (3 edits: E1-CSS, E2-engine, E3-hooks). Adds batch-level PDF mojibake/non-searchable scanning on workbook load. (A) On data load, `_p1fExtractUniqueContracts()` iterates all sheets to collect unique contract PDFs by contract_key (with Salesforce field name resolution: File_Name_c, File_URL_c, File_Name), deduplicating across sheets, skipping _change_log and RFIs sheets. (B) `_p1fBatchPdfScan()` processes the queue with concurrency=3, calling `/api/pdf/text` for each PDF and running `_p1eDetectMojibake` and `_p1eDetectNonSearchable`. (C) Flagged contracts are auto-routed to Pre-Flight as OCR_UNREADABLE (blocker) or TEXT_NOT_SEARCHABLE (warning) via `_p1fRouteToPreFlight`, with per-contract dedup. (D) Progress banner shows scanning progress, clean/flagged counts, and auto-dismisses after completion. (E) Items tagged with `_batch_scan: true` for traceability. (F) Deterministic logs: `[PDF-BATCH-SCAN][P1F] batch_scan_start`, `scan_mojibake`, `scan_clean`, `batch_scan_complete`. (G) ES5 compliant. Runtime attestation: P1F GREEN (23/23), P1F-R GREEN (24/24) on real Ostereo dataset (65 contracts, BrandRoute mojibake confirmed). Regressions GREEN (P0.2.2, P1, Cal, P0.8, P0.9, P1A, P1B, P1C, P1D, P1E).

### P1X Canonical Contract Triage View (v2.3.5)
Applied inline in `ui/viewer/index.html`. Adds canonical triage metrics and contract-centric terminology. (A) OPERATIONAL_SHEET_ALLOWLIST filters which sheets count toward canonical record totals (Accounts, Opportunities, Opportunity, Financials, Catalog, Schedule, Contact, Contacts, Asset, Custom, Service, Product, Invoice, Order, Subscription, License, Pricing). (B) Canonical metrics: contracts_total (from ContractIndex), records_total (operational rows only), affected_contracts (contracts with pre-flight issues), records_impacted (rows in affected contracts). (C) "Sheet" → "Contract Section" in all user-facing labels (Pre-Flight table, verifier/admin tables, grid selector). (D) OCR parent-bucket rollup: Pre-Flight lane card shows OCR Unreadable as parent, with Mojibake as child type in issue rows. (E) 3-tier mojibake severity: Low (1-5% replacement), Medium (5-15%), High (>15%), routed as OCR_MOJIBAKE (warning) or OCR_UNREADABLE (blocker). (F) Unknown/schema batch-only items show inline explanation instead of dead-end grid jump. (G) Deterministic logs: `[TRIAGE-CANONICAL][P1X] counts_computed`, `ocr_parent_rollup`, `grouping_rendered`, `batch_level_explainer_shown`, `route_decision`. (H) ES5 compliant. Runtime attestation: P1X GREEN (30/30), P1F-R regression GREEN (24/24).

### P1E PDF Reliability Spike (v2.3.5)
Applied via `scripts/p1e_delta.py` (5 edits: E1-CSS, E2-helpers, E3-highlight replacement, E4-nav churn, E5-diag panel). Diagnoses and hardens PDF anchor search reliability. (A) End-to-end instrumentation: `[PDF-RELIABILITY][P1E]` log prefix at every stage (field click, text candidate, search request, page jump, highlight status). (B) Mojibake/non-searchable detection: `_p1eDetectMojibake` (replacement char ratio, control chars, encoding mismatch) and `_p1eDetectNonSearchable` (empty/tiny pages), auto-routed to Pre-Flight as `OCR_UNREADABLE` or `TEXT_NOT_SEARCHABLE`. (C) Improved anchor matching: `_p1eNormalizeForSearch` (smart quotes, em-dashes, NBSP), `_p1eAsciiNormalize`, `_p1eSearchVariants` (5 variant strategies: trim, normalize, ASCII, substring, no-punct), `_p1eMatchInPages` tries all variants before failing. (D) Refresh churn reduction: `srrForcePageNav` compares base URL + page + search before setting `obj.data`, skips reload when unchanged. (E) Cache diagnostics panel: `_p1eShowDiagPanel()` exposes source URL, cache key, last loaded time, text status, page count, match attempts. (F) ES5 compliant. Runtime attestation: P1E GREEN (27/27), regressions GREEN (P0.2.2:13/13, P1:10/10, Cal:8/8, P0.8:10/10, P0.9:10/10, P1A:12/12, P1C, P1D).

### P1D.1 Contract Health Pre-Flight Table (v2.3.5)
Replaces P1D card-based grouping with a single unified nested table. (A) One `<table class="p1d1-health-table">` with parent contract rows and expandable child issue rows (accordion). (B) Parent row schema: expand caret, contract name, compact ID, source/domain hint, total issues, severity summary badges (blocker/warning), contract section chips, "View Contract" action. (C) Child row schema: Contract Section, Reference (business identifier via `_p1xGetReference`), Issue (reason chip), Severity, Status, View/Patch actions. (D) Counting semantics: affected_contracts = unique `contract_id` with ≥1 issue; records_impacted = unique `record_id` under affected contracts (not flat issue count). (E) Sorting: blockers desc → issues desc → name asc; batch-level always last. (F) `_p1d1ViewContract()` routes to contract-filtered all-data-grid. (G) Expand/collapse via `_p1dToggleGroup()` on table rows, first 5 expanded by default. (H) Deterministic logs: `[TRIAGE-CONTRACT-HEALTH][P1D.1]` prefix with 5 events: `model_built`, `parent_rows_rendered`, `child_rows_rendered`, `group_toggled`, `metrics_recomputed`. (I) ES5 compliant. (J) Contract consolidation: `_p1dGetGroupKey` normalizes by `file_name` first for stable grouping across sources; enrichment map (`_rid2contract`) resolves `record_id` → contract info from ContractIndex for signal items. (K) Standardized display names via `_p1d1ResolveAccountName()` (priority: Account_Name_c → party name fields → filename fallback) + `_p1d1GetBatchName()` (from IDENTITY_CONTEXT.dataset_id), formatted as "Account Name : Batch Name" with raw file name tooltip. (L) Sheet name extraction: `getSignalTriageItems()` parses `sheet_name` from `record_id` format `SheetName:ROW_X`. Runtime attestation: P1D.1 GREEN (40/40), regressions GREEN (P1X:30/30, P1F-R:24/24).
