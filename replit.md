# Orchestrate OS — Semantic Control Board

## Overview
Orchestrate OS is a governance-only semantic control plane for DataDash + Kiwi. Its primary purpose is to define, validate, and preview semantic rules offline, serving as a single source of semantic truth. It enables rule authoring and review as configuration, providing an analyst-first reference with clear interfaces and checklists for explicit, deterministic, and auditable decisions. The project aims to improve operator ergonomics and streamline the patch request and review pipeline.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Core Design Decisions
Orchestrate OS functions as a governance-only control plane, capturing semantic decisions as reviewable configuration artifacts without runtime execution, APIs, credentials, or prompts. It emphasizes offline-first determinism, ensuring identical outputs for the same inputs through local previews using only the Python standard library. The system employs a canonical join strategy (`contract_key` → `file_url` → `file_name`) and a Config Pack Model (`config_pack.base.json` for baseline, `config_pack.patch.json` for changes) with strict version matching.

### UI/UX and Workflow
The user interface features a dashboard shell with a queue-centric sidebar, right-side drawers for data sources and record details, and role-based navigation. Admin configurations are presented in a workflow-ordered view with Plain-English, Payload, and Master tabs, supported by extensive tooltips and Plain English explanations. The system implements an 11-status lifecycle for patch requests, including comment systems, role-based access control (Analyst, Verifier, Admin), and a Patch Studio for drafting, preflight checks, and evidence packing with live previews and revision tracking. UI/UX decisions include enforcing hard page separation, RBAC route guards, and explicit page labels. Grid cells display color-coded highlighting based on change type (corrections, RFIs, system changes, blacklist) with a color legend for the modified dataset. The PDF viewer is configured for single-column continuous scroll with hidden thumbnail sidebar.

### Data Handling and Integration
Data loading defaults to `ostereo_demo_original.json` on cold start, with an option to switch to a modified dataset. The system supports CSV/XLSX import with delimiter inference and utilities for resetting demo state. A PDF proxy (FastAPI server on port 5000) handles CORS-safe PDF fetching and field resolution using `<object>` elements for display. A Field Inspector provides search-filtered fields, inline editing, and a lock-on-commit mechanism, highlighting fields with signals and displaying patch details. A change map engine parses meta sheets (`_change_log` and `RFIs & Analyst Notes`) to build cell-level change tracking for the modified dataset. The Verifier Triage uses a 4-queue system, and a localStorage-backed mock filesystem manages artifacts with a deterministic artifact ID system. A Canonical Record Store persists records to localStorage, enabling Single Row Review (SRR) rehydration. Picklist/options fields are supported, rendering as dropdowns in the Field Inspector with validation for invalid values.

### Semantic Rules and Signals
The system generates deterministic cell-level signals on dataset load using `field_meta.json` and `qa_flags.json` for validation (e.g., `MISSING_REQUIRED`, `PICKLIST_INVALID`, `MOJIBAKE_DETECTED`, `QA_FLAG`). These signals populate Analyst Triage queues and drive grid coloring and row badges. Field Inspector ordering is derived from `field_meta.json`, `hinge_groups.json`, and `sheet_order.json` from the `/rules/rules_bundle/`. Rules follow a WHEN/THEN pattern with `rule_id`, conditions, and actions.

### Identity and Authentication
Record identity is defined by `tenant_id`, `division_id`, `dataset_id`, `record_id`, with `record_id` generated based on a canonicalized row fingerprint. A production-style landing page with Google sign-in handles user authentication, supporting `?role=admin|reviewer` URL parameters for testing. Admin-only Playground mode allows role switching, while Analyst/Reviewer users are locked to their roles. User creation and management are available in the Admin Panel for Demo/Playground mode, with changes persisting to localStorage. Production Google OAuth login checks a configured user list for role assignment.

## External Dependencies
None by design. This repository exclusively uses the Python standard library, with no external Python packages, database connections, API integrations, runtime services, or credentials/secrets. A FastAPI server is used as a local PDF proxy for CORS-safe PDF fetching.
