# Orchestrate OS — Semantic Control Board

## Overview
Orchestrate OS is a governance-only semantic control plane designed for defining, validating, and previewing semantic rules offline. It serves as a single source of semantic truth to streamline patch requests, improve operator ergonomics, and provide an analyst-first reference for explicit, deterministic, and auditable decisions. The system aims to improve semantic rule management, reduce errors, and enhance decision-making efficiency by capturing semantic decisions as reviewable configuration artifacts and operating offline-first with deterministic outputs.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture
The system employs a Config Pack Model with strict version matching, supporting a 12-status lifecycle for patch requests, including comment systems and role-based access control (Analyst, Verifier, Admin, Architect). UI/UX features include a dashboard with a queue-centric sidebar, right-side drawers, role-based navigation, and a Patch Studio for drafting and preflight checks with live previews and revision tracking. Data handling supports CSV/XLSX import, inline editing, a lock-on-commit mechanism with a change map engine, and workbook session caching to IndexedDB.

Semantic rules, defined by a WHEN/THEN pattern, generate deterministic cell-level signals using `field_meta.json` and `qa_flags.json` for validation, populating Analyst Triage queues and driving grid coloring. Access control is email-based with Google sign-in. Key features include a "Contract Line Item Wizard," XLSX export capabilities, and an Audit Timeline system. A Schema Tree Editor manages the canonical rules bundle, and a Batch Merge feature allows combining source batches. The `SystemPass` module provides a deterministic, rerunnable engine for system changes, and `UndoManager` offers session-scoped undo for draft edits. `RollbackEngine` creates governed rollback artifacts at various scopes. The Triage Analytics module aggregates metrics, and a Role Registry manages user permissions. The system includes contract-first navigation, a combined interstitial Data Quality Check, and an `ADDRESS_INCOMPLETE_CANDIDATE` Matching System. The architecture is modular, with components extracted into distinct namespaces.

The system is undergoing an upgrade to add Postgres-backed multi-user persistence, featuring resource-based routes, ULID primaries, optimistic concurrency, and server-enforced no-self-approval. Authentication uses Google OAuth for human users and scoped API keys for service ingestion, with strict workspace isolation.

An Evidence Viewer (v2.51) is fully implemented with document-level text anchoring, corrections workflow, and RFI custody tracking. All phases complete:
- Phase 1-3: Foundation, Reader+Anchors, RFI Custody+Corrections (backend + DB)
- Phase 4: Hardening (role enforcement, OCR idempotency, Mojibake Gate UI)
- Phase 5: Finalization (Reader/PDF toggle, anchor scroll mapping, 37-test suite)
- Phase 6 (UI): Evidence Viewer interactive panel in the right sidebar with three collapsible sections:
  - **Anchors Panel**: Create anchors from text selection in Reader view, list with click-to-scroll, delete capability (soft-delete via DELETE /anchors/{id})
  - **Corrections Panel**: View corrections with status chips (auto_applied/pending_verifier/approved/rejected), Approve/Reject buttons role-gated to verifier/admin/architect
  - **RFI Custody Panel**: View RFIs filtered to current document context, custody state badges (open/awaiting_verifier/returned_to_analyst/resolved/dismissed), role-appropriate action buttons (analyst: Send; verifier: Return/Resolve/Dismiss)
  - Feature-flag gated: tab only appears when EVIDENCE_INSPECTOR_V251=true (checked via GET /api/v2.5/feature-flags endpoint)
  - JS functions prefixed `ei*`, CSS classes prefixed `.ei-`, state in `_eiState` global
All behind `EVIDENCE_INSPECTOR_V251` feature flag. 37/37 smoke tests pass.

## Mode Unification (Evidence Viewer Mode)
The "Grid" mode has been renamed to "Evidence Viewer" mode with unified click behavior:
- **Review mode**: Unchanged — click a row to open Record Inspector in full review layout.
- **Evidence Viewer mode**: First single-click on any cell opens the Evidence Viewer panel for that record (no validation). Subsequent single-clicks on the same record validate cells (toggle green). Clicking a different record switches context. Double-click opens context menu.
- **Context menu**: Includes "Open in Review Mode" action that switches to Review mode and navigates to the current record.
- **State machine**: `_evState` object tracks `mode` (review/evidence_viewer), `viewMode` (reader/pdf), `viewerOpen`, `activeRecordId`, `activeSheetName`, `activeRowIdx`, `clickArmedAfterOpen`.
- Transitions: T1 (mode toggle), T2 (first click opens viewer), T3 (subsequent clicks validate), T4 (double-click context menu), T5 (Open in Review Mode), T6 (toggle back to review preserves record).

**Two-Column Layout (no page switch)**: Evidence Viewer mode uses a two-column layout inside `page-grid` via `ev-inline-wrapper` flex container:
- **Middle** (`#ev-middle-column`): Contains two stacked areas:
  - **Top** (`#ev-middle-viewer`, flex 60%): Document viewer with Reader/PDF toggle header, `<object>` PDF viewer, `#ev-reader-pane` Reader overlay (shell), empty-state with reason labels. Toggle: `_evSetViewMode('reader'|'pdf')`, default=reader. Reader pane (`#ev-reader-pane`) is structural shell — text extraction not yet wired.
  - **Bottom** (`#ev-middle-details`, max-height 40%): Evidence Details panel — collapsible Anchors, Corrections, and RFI sections. Loads data from document-scoped API endpoints.
- **Right** (`#ev-right-grid-column`): Grid table only. No Evidence Details markup exists here.
- Toggling Evidence Viewer mode ON/OFF shows/hides `#ev-middle-column` (no navigation).
- Row clicks call `_evOpenViewerForRecord()` which loads PDF inline + populates details panel. Highlights active row with `.ev-active-row`.
- Runtime assertion `_evAssertLayout()` verifies Evidence Details parent == `#ev-middle-column` and grid is inside `#ev-right-grid-column`; logs/errors on mismatch.
- Rail button (magnifying glass) opens inline viewer. "Open in Review Mode" context menu action switches to review mode and navigates to `page-row`.
- `openEvidenceViewerForRecord(recordId)` is a deterministic entry point that finds the record across all sheets.
- Record lookup: `_evFindRecord()` delegates to canonical `findRecordById(recordId)` (shared, line 10806) as single source of truth. Falls back to direct sheet[rowIdx] only if canonical lookup returns null.
- Context labels: `_evBuildContextLabel()` uses shared constants `SRR_CONTRACT_NAME_FIELDS`, `SRR_ACCOUNT_NAME_FIELDS` via `_srrResolveFieldFromList()` — no hardcoded field arrays in EV code.
- PDF URL resolution: `_evResolveDocUrl()` uses `srrResolveFieldValue(record, 'file_url')` (shared, line 33428) as single source of truth for document URL mapping. Traces record -> file_url field -> contract ref fallback -> attachment fallback, with reason codes: `no_document_link`, `mapping_not_found`, `proxy_fetch_failed`, `unsupported_format`.
- Reader mode rendering: `_evFetchReaderText(pdfProxyUrl, recordId)` extracts raw URL from proxy path (or uses direct http/https URL), calls `GET /api/pdf/text?url=`, renders per-page text blocks in `#ev-reader-content`. Error state shows "Switch to PDF View" button. Stale-request guard via `_evState._readerRequestId`.
- Reader formatting: `_evFormatReaderText()` transforms raw text into structured display — detects clause headings (numbered sections, ARTICLE/SECTION/PART), subsection numbering (1.1, a), (i)), list items (bullets, dashes), and paragraph spacing. Georgia serif font for document-like appearance. Each page includes a "Show raw text" toggle for fallback.
- Mojibake inline detection: `_evClassifyMojibake(text)` classifies each page block as `ok`, `suspect_mojibake`, or `unreadable` using heuristics: replacement char (U+FFFD) ratio, non-printable char ratio, suspicious glyph sequences, repeated char patterns. Thresholds: unreadable if >15% replacement or >10% non-printable; suspect if >5 replacements or >3% non-printable or >3 suspicious patterns. Suspect blocks get yellow highlight; unreadable blocks get red highlight with annotation disabled. Document-level badge shown per-page.
- OCR escalation CTA: `_evEscalateOcr(btn)` shown when unreadable blocks detected. Calls existing `POST /documents/{id}/ocr-escalations` endpoint with `{ escalation_type, quality_flag, affected_pages, reason }`. Reuses existing OCR escalation API and AuditTimeline event flow.
- Selection action menu: `_evBindReaderSelection()` attaches mouseup+contextmenu to reader pane. `_evGetSelectionPayload()` captures `{ selected_text, document_id, record_id, page, node_id, char_start, char_end }`. Menu actions: Copy (clipboard API + fallback), Create Evidence Mark (delegates to `eiCreateAnchor()` or direct `POST /documents/{id}/anchors`), Create RFI / Create Correction (delegates to `Components.PatchPanel.openWithContext()` with `evidence_anchor_context: true`). All actions emit `AuditTimeline` events.
- Terminology mapping (UI only, backend unchanged): "Anchors" → "Linked Fields" (panel headers, empty states), "Create Anchor" → "Create Evidence Mark" (selection menu, buttons, toasts). Tooltip: "Evidence Marks are location references in the document used for jumps, RFIs, and corrections."
- RFI flow clarity: Selection-launched RFI shows "RFI linked to selected text" confirmation toast. `patchCtx` includes `evidence_anchor_context: true` for downstream awareness.
- RFI Modal from Reader selection: `_evRfiModalOpen(payload)` opens a dedicated modal with selected text preview (gold-bordered quote block, max 300 chars), required question textarea, "Assign to" dropdown populated from `_dbMembers || getDemoUsers()`, and priority chip selector (Normal/Medium/High). `_evRfiModalSubmit()` POSTs to `POST /workspaces/{ws_id}/rfis` with `metadata.evidence_text`, `metadata.priority`, `metadata.assigned_to`, `metadata.source='ev_reader_selection'`. On success: toast, PatchPanel context registration, Evidence Details panel refresh, AuditTimeline `reader_rfi_created` event. CSS classes prefixed `.ev-rfi-`, HTML in `#ev-rfi-modal-overlay`, JS functions prefixed `_evRfi*`. Modal state in `_evRfiModalPayload` global.

**Shared SRR Name Constants** (line ~33393):
- `SRR_CONTRACT_NAME_FIELDS`: Contract_Name_c/\_\_c/clean + Opportunity variants
- `SRR_ACCOUNT_NAME_FIELDS`: Account_Name, Artist_Name, Legal_Name, Company_Name, Payee variants
- `SRR_DISPLAY_NAME_FIELDS`: Display_Name, Name, Contact_Name variants
- `SRR_ALL_NAME_FIELDS`: concat of above three (used by `_srrResolveRecordName`)
- `_srrResolveFieldFromList(record, fieldList)`: shared resolver scanning any field list with trim/guard logic
- Broader URL acceptance: accepts any `http/https` URL (not just `.pdf` extension). Rejects known non-PDF formats (doc/docx/xls/etc). Accepts Google Drive preview/view URLs.
