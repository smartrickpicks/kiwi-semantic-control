# Orchestrate OS — Semantic Control Board

## Overview
Orchestrate OS is a governance-only semantic control plane designed to define, validate, and preview semantic rules offline. It acts as a single source of semantic truth, enabling rule authoring and review as configuration. The project aims to improve operator ergonomics, streamline the patch request and review pipeline, and provide an analyst-first reference with clear interfaces for explicit, deterministic, and auditable decisions.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Core Design Decisions
Orchestrate OS is a governance-only control plane that captures semantic decisions as reviewable configuration artifacts. It operates offline-first, ensuring deterministic outputs using only the Python standard library for local previews. Key data handling includes a canonical join strategy (`contract_key` → `file_url` → `file_name`) and a Config Pack Model (`config_pack.base.json` for baseline, `config_pack.patch.json` for changes) with strict version matching.

### UI/UX and Workflow
The user interface features a dashboard with a queue-centric sidebar, right-side drawers for data sources and record details, and role-based navigation. Admin configurations are presented in a workflow-ordered view with Plain-English, Payload, and Master tabs. The system supports an 11-status lifecycle for patch requests, including comment systems, role-based access control (Analyst, Verifier, Admin), and a Patch Studio for drafting, preflight checks, and evidence packing with live previews and revision tracking. UI elements include color-coded grid highlighting for change types, Excel-style column headers with drag-and-drop reordering, and a PDF viewer configured for single-column continuous scroll. Record Inspection (SRR) provides Previous/Next navigation, a position indicator, and auto-advances to the next record upon completion. A file action bar allows editing and downloading files.

### Data Handling and Integration
The system supports CSV/XLSX import with delimiter inference and provides a failsafe "Upload Excel" button. It features a Field Inspector for search-filtered fields, inline editing, and a lock-on-commit mechanism. Glossary hover tooltips provide field metadata. A change map engine tracks cell-level changes from meta sheets (`_change_log`, `RFIs & Analyst Notes`), propagating entries to canonical stores (`PATCH_REQUEST_STORE`, `META_TRIAGE_STORE`, `System Changes queue`). The Verifier Triage uses a 4-queue system, and a localStorage-backed mock filesystem manages artifacts. A Canonical Record Store persists records to localStorage for Single Row Review rehydration. Picklist/options fields are supported with validation. Review Checklist gating enforces role-specific approval checklists. Workbook session caching persists uploaded Excel data to IndexedDB, with multi-session storage for up to 10 named sessions and an auto-save feature.

### Semantic Rules and Signals
The system generates deterministic cell-level signals on dataset load using `field_meta.json` and `qa_flags.json` for validation (e.g., `MISSING_REQUIRED`, `PICKLIST_INVALID`, `MOJIBAKE_DETECTED`, `QA_FLAG`). These signals populate Analyst Triage queues and drive grid coloring. Field Inspector ordering is derived from `field_meta.json`, `hinge_groups.json`, and `sheet_order.json` from the `/rules/rules_bundle/`. Rules follow a WHEN/THEN pattern.

### Identity and Authentication
Record identity is defined by `tenant_id`, `division_id`, `dataset_id`, `record_id`. The landing page uses email-based access control validated against an Admin Panel user list, assigning roles accordingly. Returning users are greeted with a "Welcome back" card. Google sign-in is available for production OAuth. Session persistence automatically redirects authenticated users to their last page. Patch submission enforces gate parity, requires a Replay Contract for Correction and Blacklist patches, and prevents self-approval.

### Catalog Items Grouping + Safe Batch Add
This feature allows analysts to group records under a "Catalog Items Group" and batch-add missing items with safe deduplication. Any record can be marked as a Group Anchor, and child rows inherit `group_id`. Safe deduplication normalizes text and compares items using bigram similarity, categorizing them as Existing, Possible Duplicate, or New. A 3-step wizard (Paste List → Preview → Confirm) facilitates the process.

### Document Type + Capabilities Model
Each record carries a `_document_type` and `_capabilities` object. Document types are loaded from `config/document_types.json`. Catalog Items functionality sets `capabilities.catalog_items = true`. Export includes `document_type`, `capabilities`, and `group_id` as flat columns. Grid nesting visually indents child rows under anchor rows.

### Export / Save Functionality
The Export/Save button generates an XLSX file using SheetJS, including all data sheets, `_change_log`, `RFIs & Analyst Notes`, `_signals_summary`, and `_orchestrate_meta` (dataset metadata). Exported files are named `orchestrate_{dataset_id}_{timestamp}.xlsx`.

### Session Isolation + Role Audit (v1.6.58)
Fixed session bleed between users: signing in as a different user (or role) now clears stale localStorage keys (ingestion_folder_name, nav state, viewer mode, SRR state, group state, workbook sessions, artifact playground). Sign-out also clears these keys. Demo page normalized: "Reviewer" role renamed to "Verifier" across demoProfiles, data-role attributes, and button labels to match viewer's internal setMode. Playground mode restricted: in demo mode, only Admin gets the role switcher; Analyst and Verifier are locked to their assigned roles (matching production behavior). Legacy normalizeLegacyRole() and normalizeLegacyStatus() preserved for backward compatibility.

### Audit Log (v1.6.59)
The Audit Timeline system uses an IndexedDB-backed store (`orchestrate_audit`) with a memory cache hydrated from IndexedDB on init for synchronous XLSX export after page reloads. All governance actions (patch submit, field verify/blacklist/correct, verifier approve/reject, admin promote, batch add, catalog group set, session restore) emit persisted timeline events with actor, role, timestamp, and record context. The Audit Log UI reads from this store with filters for event type, actor role, and patch request ID. The `Audit_Log` sheet is included in XLSX exports. No synthetic/demo events are generated at render time.

### V1 Polish (v1.6.60)
Status color consistency: `STATUS_COLOR_MAP` provides a single source of truth for status colors (ready, needs_review, blocked, finalized, flagged) used across grid rows, triage queue chips, and record inspection badges. A status color legend is displayed in the grid view. PDF anchor navigation no longer causes blank flash (removed intermediate `about:blank` reset). Grid row clicks always open Record Inspection; file downloads require explicit action only. Docs updated: Blacklist Category and RFI Target marked as V2-only/non-enforced in V1. Evidence Pack spec (`docs/ui/views/ui_evidence_pack.md`) created. Internal marker fields (`contract_key`, `file_name`, `file_url`, `record_id`, `sheet`, `status`, `dataset_id`, `group_id`, `document_type`, `capabilities`) are hidden from Analyst Field Inspector via `SRR_INTERNAL_FIELDS` (single source of truth with normalized key comparison). These fields are excluded from field counts, chip counts, search results, and per-field action controls. Verifier/Admin roles see them in a collapsed "System Metadata" section. Internal fields remain in the runtime data model for routing, audit, export, and system logic. PDF viewer configured for single-column continuous scroll. Record Inspection (SRR) provides Previous/Next navigation, a position indicator, and auto-advances to the next record upon completion. A file action bar allows editing and downloading files. Embedded PDF viewer toolbar kept as canonical single control surface (Strategy B); host app duplicate controls (Prev/Next, zoom buttons) hidden via `display:none` while JS functions retained for programmatic anchor navigation.

### Data Loader Pipeline Documentation (v1.6.60)
Comprehensive reference document at `docs/ingestion/DATA_LOADER_PIPELINE.md` covering the full Excel upload pipeline (file selection → SheetJS parsing → workbook population → signal generation → triage queues → grid rendering), IndexedDB-backed caching architecture (SessionDB with auto-save every 3 seconds), multi-session support (up to 10 named sessions), session restore on page load, and future plans for Google Drive integration and evolving data standards. Cross-references all key functions, line locations, configuration files, and related docs.

## External Dependencies
None by design. This repository uses only the Python standard library. A FastAPI server acts as a local PDF proxy for CORS-safe PDF fetching and text extraction using PyMuPDF. SheetJS (XLSX) is loaded via CDN for Excel import/export functionality.
### Schema Tree Editor + Alias Bundle (v2.2 P1)
Admin "Schema" tab (formerly Standardizer) provides a lazy-render tree editor for the canonical rules bundle. `SchemaTreeEditor` module (line ~9198 in `ui/viewer/index.html`) loads and renders 6 source files: `field_meta.json`, `hinge_groups.json`, `sheet_order.json`, `qa_flags.json`, `document_types.json`, and `column_aliases.json`. Tree is ordered by `sheet_order.json` with expand-on-demand. Column alias resolution: `COLUMN_ALIAS_MAP` loaded at startup from `rules/rules_bundle/column_aliases.json` (442 entries seeded from field_meta). `normalizeColumnName(name, sheetHint)` consults the alias map with sheet-specific preference before falling back to regex normalization. Unknown columns appear as PENDING nodes with classification actions: Map to Existing (alias patch), Add as New Field (schema patch), Create Tenant Rule, Ignore/Suppress. Change buffer tracks per-node edits with undo support. Drafts persist to SessionDB (`schema_editor_draft` key). Preview Diff shows color-coded changes. Export Patch generates a clipboard-ready JSON artifact. AuditTimeline events: `SCHEMA_CHANGE` with subtypes (`alias_patch`, `schema_patch`, `tenant_rule_patch`, `suppression_patch`). Existing Standardizer CSV functions preserved for backward compatibility.

### Contract Index Engine (v2.2 P0)
Implements contract-root indexing with a batch→contract→document→sheet→row hierarchy. `ContractIndex` module (line ~5272 in `ui/viewer/index.html`) builds a deterministic index after workbook population using `deriveContractId()` (UUID extraction from file_url, hash fallback), `deriveDocumentId()`, and `deriveBatchId()`. The index persists summary refs to SessionDB (IndexedDB) via `_persistToSession()` with a lightweight localStorage pointer (`orchestrate_contract_index_ptr`) for quick existence checks. On session restore, `_restoreFromSession()` loads from SessionDB first; only rebuilds if restore fails. Unknown columns with non_empty > 3 are routed to the nearest derivable contract_id or batch_id, deduplicated by (batch_id, scope_type, scope_id, sheet, normalized_name) using a seen{} hash. AuditTimeline events emitted: CONTRACT_INDEX_BUILT, BATCH_CREATED, UNKNOWN_COLUMN_DETECTED, CONTRACT_ROLLUP_UPDATED (with aggregate counts and sample contract IDs). Fail-open safety: if indexing throws, a warning banner appears and the grid operates in row-only mode with no contract features visible.
