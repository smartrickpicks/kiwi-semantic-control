# Orchestrate OS — Semantic Control Board

## Overview
Orchestrate OS is a governance-only semantic control plane designed to define, validate, and preview semantic rules offline. It acts as a single source of semantic truth for authoring and reviewing semantic rules as configuration. The project aims to enhance operator ergonomics, streamline the patch request and review pipeline, and provide an analyst-first reference for explicit, deterministic, and auditable decisions. It captures semantic decisions as reviewable configuration artifacts and operates offline-first, ensuring deterministic outputs using only the Python standard library for local previews.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Terminology
- **Contract Section** is the canonical UI term for what was previously called "sheet", "worksheet", or "tab". All visible labels use "Contract Section". Internal storage keys (`sheet_name`, `sheets`, `activeSheet`, `gridState.sheet`) are preserved for backward compatibility. The utility function `normalizeContractSectionTerm(term)` maps legacy aliases to the canonical value and logs a one-time `[TERM-ALIAS]` console message when a legacy alias is used.
- **Record Inspector** is the canonical UI term for the row-level detail drawer (legacy alias: "Single Row Review" / "SRR"). Internal variable names like `srrState` are preserved.
- **Contract Line Items** is the canonical UI term for line-item records within a contract (legacy alias: "Catalog Items"). The Contract Line Item Wizard uses this term throughout.
- **Grid Context Menu** provides quick actions via right-click or double-click on any Grid Mode cell/row. Actions: Open Record Inspector, Create Correction, Create RFI, Create Blacklist, Add Contract Line Items, Open in Glossary. All data-changing actions route through the patch lifecycle. Deterministic logs use `[GRID-CONTEXT][P0]` prefix. Audit events: `grid_context_menu_opened`, `grid_context_action_triggered`.
  - **Role Gating Matrix**: Analyst (inspect, correction, rfi, line-items, glossary), Verifier (inspect, rfi, glossary), Admin/Architect (all). Disabled actions show tooltip with reason (e.g., "Verifier role cannot correction", "Select a field first", "System field cannot be corrected", "Contract context missing"). Central guard: `getGridContextActionState(action, ctx, role)`. Menu sections: Navigation, Patch Actions, Line Item Actions, Reference. Summary log: `[GRID-CONTEXT][P2] menu_rendered role=<role> enabled=<n> disabled=<n>`.

## System Architecture
The core design principle involves capturing semantic decisions as reviewable configuration artifacts. The system employs a canonical join strategy for data handling and a Config Pack Model with strict version matching. It supports an 11-status lifecycle for patch requests, including comment systems and role-based access control (Analyst, Verifier, Admin, Architect).

The UI features a dashboard with a queue-centric sidebar, right-side drawers for data sources and record details, and role-based navigation. Admin configurations are organized into six tabs: Governance (artifact registry, baselines, evidence gates), Schema & Standards (schema tree editor, unknown columns), Patch Ops (queue + console), People & Access (members, roles, invites), QA Runner, and Runtime Config (config inspector, glossary, JSON inspector). Architect Controls remain in a shared bottom utility rail. A Patch Studio facilitates drafting, preflight checks, and evidence packing with live previews and revision tracking. UI elements include color-coded grid highlighting, Excel-style column headers, and a PDF viewer.

Data handling supports CSV/XLSX import, inline editing, and a lock-on-commit mechanism. A change map engine tracks cell-level changes. The Verifier Triage uses a 4-queue system, and a localStorage-backed mock filesystem manages artifacts. Workbook session caching persists uploaded Excel data to IndexedDB, supporting multi-session storage and auto-save. Triage Analytics schema matching uses normalized key comparison and `COLUMN_ALIAS_MAP` resolution.

Semantic rules generate deterministic cell-level signals on dataset load using `field_meta.json` and `qa_flags.json` for validation, populating Analyst Triage queues and driving grid coloring. Rules follow a WHEN/THEN pattern. Record identity is defined by `tenant_id`, `division_id`, `dataset_id`, `record_id`. The system uses email-based access control with Google sign-in for production OAuth.

Features include a "Contract Line Item Wizard" for batch adding and deduplication with metadata-driven validation. Export functionality generates XLSX files including all data, change logs, signals summaries, and metadata. An Audit Timeline system uses an IndexedDB-backed store for all governance actions, accessible via a UI with filtering and export options.

The system incorporates a Schema Tree Editor for managing the canonical rules bundle, including `field_meta.json`, `hinge_groups.json`, `sheet_order.json`, `qa_flags.json`, `document_types.json`, and `column_aliases.json`. It supports column alias resolution and tracking of schema changes. A Batch Merge feature allows combining source batches into a single governance container, with explicit rule promotion for tenant rules. Unknown Columns and Unmapped Headers tables use batch-wide condensation: columns appearing across most sections (e.g., "File", "UID") are grouped into a single "Batch-wide" row, while section-specific columns are shown separately. A "Link to Glossary" action on each unknown/unmapped column opens a searchable glossary picker (442 fields from field_meta.json), allowing analysts to alias an unknown column to a canonical field. On save, the alias is stored in localStorage (`user_column_aliases`), COLUMN_ALIAS_MAP is updated in memory, the workbook data is renamed, and the column is removed from the unknown list.

Document roles are inferred with user confirmation. A `SystemPass` module provides a deterministic, rerunnable, proposal-only engine for system changes, routed to a "System Changes" triage bucket. Pre-Flight triage buckets handle blockers like unknown columns or unreadable OCR. A Contract Index Engine builds a hierarchy of batch→contract→document→contract section→row, persisting summary references to SessionDB.

`UndoManager` provides local, session-scoped undo for draft-only inline edits. `RollbackEngine` creates governed rollback artifacts at 4 scopes (field, patch, contract, batch), capturing before/after state snapshots. Audit events are generated for all these actions.

The Triage Analytics module aggregates metrics into a lightweight cache. Triage Telemetry provides live pipeline telemetry with processing status banners and lifecycle deltas. Record Inspector Guidance provides section-specific advice.

Contract ID derivation enforces priority. ContractIndex is always rebuilt from the workbook on all load paths. Unknown column routing uses section-scoped frequency voting for contract attachment. Header-echo rows are removed at parse time. Sandbox mode is permissionless; Production uses strict role gates. A Pre-Flight Calibration Suite ensures the accuracy of pre-flight detectors. A TruthPack module with an `architect` role enables a clean-room state machine for calibration and baseline marking. A Role Registry with stable role IDs, permission-based access checks, and a People workspace are integrated. Truth Config versioning stores baselines in SessionDB with a test_mode/established lifecycle and rollback capability. An Invite system provides single-use invite creation, use, and revocation with audit events.

The system routes to triage by default for all roles. Contract-first navigation is implemented in the All Data Grid. A legacy double-slash annotation sanitizer cleans URL and business fields during XLSX and CSV parsing. Pre-Flight items now include section-specific tabs and human-readable labels for blockers.

## External Dependencies
A FastAPI server acts as a local PDF proxy for CORS-safe PDF fetching and text extraction using PyMuPDF. SheetJS (XLSX) is loaded via CDN for Excel import/export functionality. The application includes several modules for specific functionalities:
- **P1C Contract Composite Grid**: Enhances the All Data Grid with nested, collapsible contract sections when a specific contract is selected.
- **P1F Batch PDF Scan**: Adds batch-level PDF scanning for mojibake/non-searchable content on workbook load, routing flagged contracts to Pre-Flight.
- **P1X Canonical Contract Triage View**: Adds canonical triage metrics and contract-centric terminology, refining how contract sections count towards canonical record totals and displaying OCR issues.
- **P1E PDF Reliability Spike**: Diagnoses and hardens PDF anchor search reliability, including mojibake/non-searchable detection and improved anchor matching strategies.
- **P1D.1 Contract Health Pre-Flight Table**: Replaces card-based grouping with a single unified nested table for contract health, displaying parent contract rows with expandable child issue rows.
- **P1F.1 Real-Time Pre-Flight Intake**: Provides real-time visibility into the batch PDF scan as it processes files, displaying live status and immediately emitting Pre-Flight items upon detection.
- **P1F.2 Clean-to-SystemPass Routing**: Routes clean-scanned contracts to the System Pass queue as `PDF_VERIFIED_CLEAN` signals. Adds contract rollup status fields.
- **P1G Contract Health Score**: A lifecycle-wide health scoring engine that tracks contract health from extraction through promotion. Computes a 0-100 score using a penalty model. Health bands are Critical (0-34), At Risk (35-59), Watch (60-84), Healthy (85-100). Health column appears in Contract Summary table plus all lifecycle queue tables, with colored band chips and penalty breakdown tooltips. Filter chips allow filtering Contract Summary by health band. Worst-first sorting surfaces critical contracts. Trend tracking shows score deltas between refreshes.
- **Data Quality Check (Combined Interstitial)**: A unified modal that fires automatically after workbook load, BEFORE Pre-Flight. Combines duplicate account detection and incomplete address candidate matching into a single tabbed interface. The "Duplicate Accounts" tab uses fuzzy name matching (substring, prefix, first+last token) to detect near-duplicate account names, presenting side-by-side schema trees for comparison. The "Incomplete Addresses" tab shows address candidates with missing components and suggested merges. A "Rerun" button in the modal header re-scans both checks on demand. The Schema Snapshot card ("Data Quality") shows combined pending counts for both check types and clicking it reopens the modal. Both checks trigger on workbook upload and session restore. Audit events emitted on resolution. The old individual address merge modal is preserved for one-off Pre-Flight access.
- **Grid Mode (All Data Grid)**: Review/Grid mode toggle on the All Data Grid toolbar. Review Mode (default) preserves existing row-click-to-open-Record-Inspector behavior. Grid Mode adds a frozen first-rail column (position:sticky, left:0) with Inspector, PDF, and Download buttons per row. Opportunities sections show Account Name in the rail. Alternating row striping improves readability. Inline cell editing via click-to-edit with Enter (commit), Esc (cancel), Tab (commit + advance) keyboard handling. Committed edits are recorded as pending patch context (`_gridPendingEdits`) with old_value, new_value, field_key, record_id, and contract_section. Edit badge shows pending count. Sandbox mode bypasses evidence and preflight gates for patch submission.
- **ADDRESS_INCOMPLETE_CANDIDATE Matching System**: Deterministic candidate matching for incomplete addresses using normalized fingerprints (country+street+city+state+postal) within batch scope. Scans billing, shipping, and mailing address field groups from Accounts and Contacts contract sections (legacy: sheets). Detects rows with exactly one missing address component, builds fingerprints from available parts, and matches against other rows in the same batch/prefix group. Single-candidate matches produce resolvable `ADDRESS_INCOMPLETE_CANDIDATE` warnings; zero or multiple matches produce `ADDRESS_INCOMPLETE_AMBIGUOUS` blockers. Country match is required. Accept action writes the candidate value into the workbook; dismiss suppresses the item for the session. Decisions persisted in localStorage (`address_candidate_decisions`). Items merge into Pre-Flight pipeline and participate in lifecycle `hasBlockers` checks. Audit events emitted on resolution via `_resolveAddressCandidate()`.
