# Orchestrate OS — Semantic Control Board

## Overview
Orchestrate OS is a governance-only semantic control plane designed for defining, validating, and previewing semantic rules offline. It serves as a single source of semantic truth to streamline patch requests, improve operator ergonomics, and provide an analyst-first reference for explicit, deterministic, and auditable decisions. The system aims to improve semantic rule management, reduce errors, and enhance decision-making efficiency by capturing semantic decisions as reviewable configuration artifacts and operating offline-first with deterministic outputs. It focuses on improving semantic rule management, reducing errors, and enhancing decision-making efficiency.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture
The system employs a Config Pack Model with strict version matching and supports a 12-status lifecycle for patch requests, including comment systems and role-based access control. The UI/UX features a dashboard with a queue-centric sidebar, right-side drawers, role-based navigation, and a Patch Studio for drafting and preflight checks with live previews and revision tracking. Data handling supports CSV/XLSX import, inline editing, a lock-on-commit mechanism with a change map engine, and workbook session caching.

Semantic rules, defined by a WHEN/THEN pattern, generate deterministic cell-level signals using metadata for validation, populating Analyst Triage queues and driving grid coloring. Access control is email-based with Google sign-in. Key features include a "Contract Line Item Wizard," XLSX export capabilities, and an Audit Timeline system. A Schema Tree Editor manages the canonical rules bundle, and a Batch Merge feature allows combining source batches. The `SystemPass` module provides a deterministic, rerunnable engine for system changes, and `UndoManager` offers session-scoped undo for draft edits. `RollbackEngine` creates governed rollback artifacts, and a Triage Analytics module aggregates metrics. A Role Registry manages user permissions. The system includes contract-first navigation, a combined interstitial Data Quality Check, and an `ADDRESS_INCOMPLETE_CANDIDATE` Matching System. The architecture is modular, with components extracted into distinct namespaces.

The system is being upgraded to include Postgres-backed multi-user persistence, featuring resource-based routes, ULID primaries, optimistic concurrency, and server-enforced no-self-approval. Authentication uses Google OAuth for human users and scoped API keys for service ingestion, with strict workspace isolation.

An Evidence Viewer (v2.51) is implemented with document-level text anchoring, corrections workflow, and RFI custody tracking. It provides an interactive panel with three collapsible sections: Anchors Panel for creating and managing anchors, Corrections Panel for viewing and approving/rejecting corrections, and RFI Custody Panel for managing RFIs. The "Grid" mode has been renamed to "Evidence Viewer" mode with unified click behavior that prioritizes opening the Evidence Viewer panel on the first click and subsequent clicks for cell validation. A context menu allows opening records in "Review Mode." The Evidence Viewer mode uses a two-column layout with a document viewer (Reader/PDF toggle) and an Evidence Details panel on the left, and the grid table on the right. The Reader mode includes text extraction, formatting for readability (detecting headings, lists, paragraphs), Mojibake inline detection with visual classifications (suspect/unreadable), and an OCR escalation CTA. A selection action menu allows creating Evidence Marks, RFIs, and Corrections directly from selected text. RFI and Encoding Correction modals facilitate dedicated workflows, with policy-driven status assignments. RFI lifecycle propagation ensures that RFIs created in the Evidence Viewer are injected into both analyst and verifier queues, with deep-linking capabilities back to the Evidence Viewer. The system displays RFI thread replies in the triage queue table and uses a notification badge system to indicate unseen RFIs. Role-based visibility for RFIs is applied across the Evidence Details panel and triage queues. Shared constants are used for resolving contract, account, and display names. The system accepts various http/https URLs for documents, including Google Drive links, but rejects known non-PDF formats.

Grid Record Labels (v2.53): The first data column in the grid uses a standardized naming convention — `Contract: Account` for account sheets, or `Contract: Account: Opportunity` for opportunity sheets. The contract name is derived from the file name, and the account/opportunity names from their respective data fields. This first column is frozen (sticky) so it remains visible during horizontal scrolling. The `_gridBuildRecordLabel()` function resolves the composite label, applied in both standard and batch grid render paths.

Sandbox Session Management (v2.52): Sandbox-created artifacts (RFIs, patches, corrections, queue items) persist indefinitely until explicit admin reset — no TTL expiration. Two reset options are available in admin-only UI sections: (1) "Reset Sandbox" clears all sandbox-created artifacts while preserving uploaded data, and (2) "Reset All Data" performs a full reset including uploaded datasets, returning to the loader screen. The `_evRfiLocalCache` stores sandbox RFIs without time-based expiry; `resetPlayground()` clears the cache along with verifier queue, patch storage, and badge state. `resetDemoState()` gates sandbox clearing to playground environment only, preventing accidental production data loss.

Suggested Fields + Alias Builder (v2.51): A heuristic suggestion engine analyzes source document column headers and proposes mappings to canonical glossary terms. The engine supports three matching strategies: exact (score 1.0), fuzzy (Levenshtein ratio >= 0.6), and keyword (category-based term matching). Results are presented in a "Suggestions" tab in the grid float controls, grouped by match type (exact/fuzzy/keyword/unmatched). Users can Accept or Decline suggestions; accepting auto-creates a glossary alias linking the source field to the canonical term. Duplicate aliases return 409 with details of the existing mapping. The feature uses 4 new DB tables: glossary_terms, glossary_aliases, suggestion_runs, suggestions. ULID prefixes: glt_, gla_, sgr_, sug_. Backend routes: server/routes/suggestions.py, server/routes/glossary.py (includes PATCH /glossary/aliases/{id} with OCC). Engine: server/suggestion_engine.py. Frontend fetch calls include X-Workspace-Id header via _syncHeaders() helper. OpenAPI: docs/api/openapi.yaml includes full Suggested Fields tag with glossary/terms, glossary/aliases, suggestions/run, suggestions endpoints. Design doc: docs/handoff/V251_SUGGESTED_FIELDS_DESIGN.md. Audit: docs/handoff/V251_SUGGESTED_FIELDS_AUDIT.md.

Multi-Workspace Glossary Routing: All glossary endpoints (GET /glossary/terms, POST /glossary/terms, POST /glossary/aliases, PATCH /glossary/aliases/{id}) require explicit workspace selection via `X-Workspace-Id` header, `workspace_id` body field, or JWT `workspace_id` claim. Missing workspace returns 422 MISSING_WORKSPACE. Membership is verified against `user_workspace_roles`; non-members get 403 FORBIDDEN. No implicit "first workspace" fallback exists. The `_require_workspace_id()` helper in `server/routes/glossary.py` enforces this contract. Verification: CHECK 6 in `scripts/verify_suggested_fields.py` covers multi-workspace reads, writes, missing selector, and non-member access (71 total checks).

Section Metadata Integration (v2.53): The `orderFieldsForInspector()` function in the record inspector reads `enrichments.section_metadata` from `field_meta.json`. When section_headers and field_section_map are present for a sheet, fields are grouped by section (using `section_key`) and ordered by `question_order`. Section titles and descriptions from `section_headers` are displayed as group headers. If section_metadata is absent for a sheet, the legacy hinge-based grouping (Primary/Secondary/Other) is used as fallback. The `_getSectionMetadata()` helper retrieves metadata, and `_orderFieldsBySectionMetadata()` builds the grouped ordering.

Section Focus Guidance (v2.53): The `renderSectionGuidanceCard()` function first checks `section_focus` from `enrichments.section_metadata` for the current sheet. If available, it uses that text as the "what to look for" guidance. If section_focus is unavailable, it falls back to `config/section_guidance.json`. The `_getSectionFocusFromMeta()` helper resolves section_focus from the metadata. The guidance card UI shell (section label, what_to_look_for, common_failure_modes) is preserved.

Module Registry (v2.53): `Engines.SuggestionsState` and `Components.SuggestionsPanel` registered in AppModules Phase D16. SuggestionsState provides accessors for sync state, document/workspace IDs, and headers. SuggestionsPanel provides toggle, run, accept, decline, and refresh operations. Total registered modules: ~50+ across D1-D16 phases.

UX Fine-Tuning (v2.53): Locked clarity decisions Q1-Q5 all Option A. Slim section group headers with info modal (no collapsible blocks). Canonical field labels from `field_meta.field_label` with `__c`/`_c` stripping fallback. Sticky guidance card with prose rendering, source badge, and collapsed preview. Live contract chip refresh via `orchestrate:role_confirmed` CustomEvent. Bulk verify by section with confirmation dialog and `fields_bulk_verified` audit event (scoped via data-section attributes). Inline mojibake character highlighting via `_evInlineMojiHighlight()`. Context menu parity: "Open in Evidence Viewer" in grid (role-gated), "Create Alias" in EV text selection menu. Linked fields placeholder with `_resolveLinkedFields()` stub. EV-004 anchor count badge with pill styling. QA-001 `section_meta` suite in QARunner. DOC-001 schema documentation at `docs/handoff/V253_SECTION_METADATA_SCHEMA.md`.

Create Alias (v2.54): The text selection menu in the Evidence Viewer Reader replaces "Open in Glossary" with "Create Alias." Highlighting text and clicking "Create Alias" opens a modal (`_aliasModalOpen`) showing a searchable list of canonical glossary terms filtered by current sheet. Selecting a term and confirming: (1) creates a glossary alias via POST `/api/v2.5/glossary/aliases`, (2) auto-populates the corresponding grid cell with the highlighted text value, (3) creates an evidence mark anchoring the text in the document, and (4) emits an `alias_created_from_reader` audit event. Fallback: if the API is unavailable, terms are derived from local workbook headers. The grid cell flashes green on update. CSS class prefix: `.alias-modal-*`. JS functions: `_aliasModalOpen()`, `_aliasModalClose()`, `_aliasModalFilter()`, `_aliasSelectTerm()`, `_aliasModalConfirm()`, `_aliasApplyLocal()`.

Enhanced Contract Line Items (v2.54): When right-clicking a grid row and choosing "Add Contract Line Items…", the batch add modal now captures source row context via `window._gridCtxLineItemScope`. If a field_key is set (the column you clicked), it becomes the target field. The source row's non-internal fields are cloned into `batchAddState.sourceRow`. During commit (`batchAddRows`), new rows inherit all fields from the source row except the target field, which gets the pasted item text. This enables "duplicate row, change one field" workflows for adding missing records (e.g., missing songs in a contract). When no context scope is set, existing batch add behavior is preserved.

Document Mode Preflight (v2.54): A deterministic page/document classification and quality gate system for PDF documents. The preflight engine (`server/preflight_engine.py`) classifies pages as SEARCHABLE, SCANNED, or MIXED using locked P1E thresholds (chars >= 50 AND image_ratio <= 0.70 for SEARCHABLE, chars < 50 AND image_ratio >= 0.30 for SCANNED). Document mode aggregates page modes (>= 80% supermajority). Gate colors: GREEN (all checks pass), YELLOW (mixed mode, low avg chars, or sparse pages), RED (replacement_char_ratio > 0.05 OR control_char_ratio > 0.03). API routes (`server/routes/preflight.py`): POST /api/preflight/run (analyze PDF), GET /api/preflight/{doc_id} (read cached result), POST /api/preflight/action (Accept Risk / Escalate OCR). All routes require v2.5 Either auth, workspace isolation, and admin-only sandbox RBAC gate. Feature flags: `PREFLIGHT_GATE_SYNC` (canonical) and `PREFLIGHT_GATE_SYNC_V251` (alias), both default OFF. GET /api/pdf/text_layout endpoint provides layout-aware text extraction with per-span bboxes and font info. UI: Preflight tab in float controls, gate badge display, metrics panel, action buttons. Submit gating via `srrCheckSyncPreflightGate()` in `validateSubmissionGates()` — bypasses non-admin users during sandbox stage. Cache-only persistence (no database writes); evidence pack IDs generated on action with patch_id. Documentation: 6 files in docs/handoff/PREFLIGHT_*.md and PIPELINE_DECISIONS.md. Tests: scripts/test_preflight.py (36 tests).
