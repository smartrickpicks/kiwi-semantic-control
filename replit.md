# Orchestrate OS — Semantic Control Board

## Overview
Orchestrate OS is a governance-only semantic control plane for defining, validating, and previewing semantic rules offline. It serves as a single source of semantic truth for authoring and reviewing semantic rules as configuration, aiming to improve operator ergonomics, streamline the patch request and review pipeline, and provide an analyst-first reference for explicit, deterministic, and auditable decisions. The system captures semantic decisions as reviewable configuration artifacts and operates offline-first, ensuring deterministic outputs using only the Python standard library for local previews.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture
The core design principle involves capturing semantic decisions as reviewable configuration artifacts. The system employs a canonical join strategy for data handling and a Config Pack Model with strict version matching, supporting an 11-status lifecycle for patch requests, including comment systems and role-based access control (Analyst, Verifier, Admin, Architect).

The UI features a dashboard with a queue-centric sidebar, right-side drawers for data sources and record details, and role-based navigation. Admin configurations are organized into six tabs: Governance, Schema & Standards, Patch Ops, People & Access, QA Runner, and Runtime Config. A Patch Studio facilitates drafting, preflight checks, and evidence packing with live previews and revision tracking. UI elements include color-coded grid highlighting, Excel-style column headers, and a PDF viewer.

Data handling supports CSV/XLSX import, inline editing, and a lock-on-commit mechanism, with a change map engine tracking cell-level changes. Workbook session caching persists uploaded Excel data to IndexedDB, supporting multi-session storage and auto-save. Triage Analytics schema matching uses normalized key comparison and `COLUMN_ALIAS_MAP` resolution.

Semantic rules generate deterministic cell-level signals on dataset load using `field_meta.json` and `qa_flags.json` for validation, populating Analyst Triage queues and driving grid coloring. Rules follow a WHEN/THEN pattern. Record identity is defined by `tenant_id`, `division_id`, `dataset_id`, `record_id`. The system uses email-based access control with Google sign-in for production OAuth.

Features include a "Contract Line Item Wizard" for batch adding and deduplication with metadata-driven validation. Export functionality generates XLSX files including all data, change logs, signals summaries, and metadata. An Audit Timeline system uses an IndexedDB-backed store for all governance actions.

A Schema Tree Editor manages the canonical rules bundle, including `field_meta.json`, `hinge_groups.json`, `sheet_order.json`, `qa_flags.json`, `document_types.json`, and `column_aliases.json`. It supports column alias resolution and tracking of schema changes. A Batch Merge feature allows combining source batches into a single governance container, with explicit rule promotion for tenant rules. Unknown Columns and Unmapped Headers tables use batch-wide condensation for display, with a "Link to Glossary" action for aliasing unknown columns.

A `SystemPass` module provides a deterministic, rerunnable, proposal-only engine for system changes. Pre-Flight triage buckets handle blockers like unknown columns or unreadable OCR. A Contract Index Engine builds a hierarchy of batch→contract→document→contract section→row, persisting summary references to SessionDB.

`UndoManager` provides local, session-scoped undo for draft-only inline edits. `RollbackEngine` creates governed rollback artifacts at four scopes (field, patch, contract, batch), capturing before/after state snapshots.

The Triage Analytics module aggregates metrics into a lightweight cache. Triage Telemetry provides live pipeline telemetry. Record Inspector Guidance provides section-specific advice. Sandbox mode is permissionless; Production uses strict role gates. A Pre-Flight Calibration Suite ensures the accuracy of pre-flight detectors. A TruthPack module with an `architect` role enables a clean-room state machine for calibration and baseline marking. A Role Registry with stable role IDs, permission-based access checks, and a People workspace are integrated. Truth Config versioning stores baselines in SessionDB with a test_mode/established lifecycle and rollback capability. An Invite system provides single-use invite creation, use, and revocation.

The system routes to triage by default for all roles. Contract-first navigation is implemented in the All Data Grid. Pre-Flight items now include section-specific tabs and human-readable labels for blockers. Grid Mode introduces inline cell editing and pending patch context tracking. A combined interstitial Data Quality Check for duplicate accounts and incomplete addresses fires automatically after workbook load. The `ADDRESS_INCOMPLETE_CANDIDATE` Matching System provides deterministic candidate matching for incomplete addresses, routing warnings and blockers to Pre-Flight.
