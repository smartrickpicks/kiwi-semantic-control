# Orchestrate OS — Semantic Control Board

## Overview

Orchestrate OS is a governance-only semantic control plane for DataDash + Kiwi, designed to define, validate, and preview semantic rules offline. Its core purpose is to serve as a single source of semantic truth, enabling rule authoring and review as configuration rather than code. It aims to provide an analyst-first reference with clear interfaces and checklists, ensuring explicit, deterministic, and auditable decisions. The project focuses on improving operator ergonomics and streamlining the patch request and review pipeline.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Repository Structure

The repository is organized into `docs/` for documentation, `rules/` for rule authoring templates, `config/` for semantic configuration, `examples/` for synthetic data, `local_runner/` for offline validation tools, `scripts/` for utilities, and `ui/` for the user interface skeleton.

### Core Design Decisions

1.  **Governance-Only Control Plane**: All semantic decisions are captured as reviewable configuration artifacts, with no runtime execution, APIs, credentials, or prompts.
2.  **Offline-First Determinism**: Ensures identical outputs for the same inputs, with all previews running locally without network access, using only the Python standard library.
3.  **Join Strategy**: Employs a canonical join order (`contract_key` → `file_url` → `file_name`) without fabricating identifiers, explicitly surfacing unmatched cases.
4.  **Config Pack Model**: Utilizes `config_pack.base.json` for the versioned baseline semantic model and `config_pack.patch.json` for changes, with strict version matching.
5.  **UI/UX**: Features a dashboard shell with a queue-centric sidebar, right-side drawers for data sources and record details, and role-based navigation. Admin configurations are presented in a workflow-ordered view with Plain-English, Payload, and Master tabs. The system includes extensive tooltips and Plain English explanations derived from nomenclature maps.
6.  **Patch Request Pipeline**: Implements a robust 11-status lifecycle for patch requests, including comment systems, role-based access control (Analyst, Verifier, Admin), and a Patch Studio for drafting, preflight checks, and evidence packing. It includes structured intent authoring with live previews and revision tracking with audit logging.
7.  **Data Loading and Testing**: Features a dedicated loader for sample datasets, CSV/XLSX import with delimiter inference, and utilities for resetting demo state and rebuilding field indexes.
8.  **UI-ADMIN-ENTITY-SEPARATION**: Enforces hard page separation, RBAC route guards, and explicit page labels for clear navigation and security.
9.  **DataDash V1 Operator Ergonomics**: Introduces an All-Data Grid for a dense spreadsheet view, deterministic filtering, and a consistent entry point for single-row review.
10. **PDF Proxy and Field Resolution (v1.4.18)**: Utilizes a unified FastAPI server on port 5000 that serves both the viewer static files and the PDF proxy endpoint (`/proxy/pdf`) for CORS-safe PDF fetching. The proxy includes `srrResolveFieldValue()` for Salesforce-style column resolution, security guards (SSRF protection, host allowlist), and size limits. The unified architecture ensures the proxy is accessible on the same origin as the viewer, avoiding cross-origin port issues in hosted environments. **PDF Display (v1.4.19)**: Uses `<object>` element instead of `<iframe>` for PDF rendering to work around Chrome's security restriction that blocks blob URLs in nested iframe contexts (Replit's webview). Includes fallback "Open in New Tab" link when browser blocks embedded viewer.
11. **Field Inspector and Patch Editor**: Provides search-filtered fields, inline editing, a lock-on-commit mechanism for changed fields, and a restructured Evidence Pack with dropdown selectors and optional notes.
12. **Verifier Triage and Payload System**: Offers a 4-queue system for verifiers, automatic view swapping based on roles, and type-specific content blocks for reviews. v1.5.2 adds division + status filter bars with localStorage persistence, shared filter state between Triage and Grid, status-based row highlighting (yellow=pending, orange=clarification, blue=sent_to_admin, green=resolved), and proper routing via patch_request_id to Verifier Review.
13. **Artifact Store and Role Handoff Routing**: Uses a localStorage-backed mock filesystem for artifacts, a deterministic artifact ID system, event logging, and a thread system for conversations. It supports playground mode with environment scoping and a seamless handoff from Verifier Approval to the Admin Patch Queue.
14. **Record Identity Model**: Defines `tenant_id`, `division_id`, `dataset_id`, `record_id` as first-class identity fields, with source pointers and aliases, and generates `record_id` based on a canonicalized row fingerprint.
15. **SRR Hydration**: Ensures proper hydration of Single Row Review (SRR) by loading PatchRequests from a shared `localStorage` store before loading record data.
16. **Reviewer SRR Mode (v1.5.3)**: When reviewers click a triage row, they open SRR directly (not intermediate Verifier Review). Reviewer SRR shows: left panel with Field Inspector (mixed-state editing - verified fields read-only, pending fields actionable), right panel with Patch Review showing per-field submitted data and action buttons (Approve/Clarify/Reject). Division filter includes "Unassigned" bucket. Patch type tabs (Corrections, Blacklist, RFI) for grouping. Reviewer mode resets on navigation. **Multi-Issue Editing**: Reviewers can action multiple pending fields. Per-field patch type derived from submitted change category. Reviewer actions log audit events and update PatchRequest status. **Role-Consistent Visibility (v1.5.3)**: `setMode()` calls `reloadReviewerQueuesFromStore()` to populate queues from canonical stores (PATCH_REQUEST_STORE + ArtifactStore) without relying on analyst SRR state. **RFI Scoping (v1.5.3)**: RFI submit only clears the selected field; other pending RFIs remain. **ID Handling (v1.5.3)**: `loadVerifierReviewData()` accepts both `PR_` (PatchRequest) and `art_` (Artifact) prefixes.
17. **Canonical Record Store (v1.5.3)**: Persists records to localStorage at path `kiwi/v1/{tenant_id}/records/{dataset_id}/{record_id}.json` on every dataset load (sample, CSV, XLSX, session restore). Enables SRR rehydration by record_id even after page refresh. `findRecordById()` falls back to store when workbook lookup fails. `openRecordFromPayload()` uses PatchRequest-first loading with multi-source fallback chain and blocking errors for missing identity fields. Record identity is generated on-the-fly during persistence using `sheetName:rowIndex` pattern, with `IDENTITY_CONTEXT.dataset_id` set from sheetName during CSV load for consistent key alignment.
18. **Landing Page and Mock Auth (v1.4.20)**: New landing page at `/ui/landing/` with mock Google sign-in and role selector (Analyst/Reviewer/Admin). Stores role in `localStorage.currentRole`, syncs to viewer's `viewer_mode_v10`. Root URL redirects to landing page; clicking "Continue with Google" navigates to viewer with selected role. Demo badge clearly indicates no real authentication.
19. **Admin User Panel (v1.4.21)**: Admin-only "Users" tab in Admin Panel for demo role assignment. Table shows 8 stub demo users with columns: User (avatar + name), Email, Role (dropdown), Status (Active badge), Actions (Save). Role changes persist to localStorage. Toast notification when current user's role is changed. Reset to Defaults button restores original demo users.
20. **Role-Based Navigation (v1.4.22)**: Enforces role-specific nav visibility and route protection. Analyst sees Triage, All Data Grid, Record Inspection, Patch Studio. Reviewer sees Triage, All Data Grid, Record Inspection, Verifier Review, Config Inspector. Admin sees all plus Admin Approval, Governance, Config Flows. Unauthorized routes show "Access Restricted" page with role-specific message and "Go to My Dashboard" / "Switch Role" buttons. Default landing: Admin→Admin Panel, Analyst/Reviewer→Triage. CSS classes `analyst-only`, `reviewer-only`, `admin-only` control nav visibility.
21. **Folder-Based Data Source (v1.4.24)**: Folder is auto-mapped from user email on sign-in (no manual selection). Landing page stores `demoUser` with email, name, and folder. Viewer derives folder name from `demoUser.folder` or parses email (sarah.chen@demo → "Sarah Chen"). Connected Folder card is centered and read-only (no Change Folder/Sync buttons). "Locally Cached Files" replaced with "Drive Files (Read-Only)" stub showing mocked files derived from user's folder name. Demo/sample datasets purged on load. Active data source bar shows auto-mapped folder name.
22. **SRR Role-Specific Rendering (v1.5.3)**: `openRowReviewDrawer()` determines `isReadOnly` based on `currentMode` at render time - analyst mode allows editing, reviewer/admin modes are read-only. `setMode()` calls `resetReviewerSRRMode()`/`initReviewerSRRMode()` and re-renders field inspector when switching roles while SRR is open. Store fallback in `vrOpenSingleRowReview()` loads records from canonical store when workbook lookup fails, injects into workbook for subsequent lookups.
23. **Analyst Triage Multi-Queue Dashboard (v1.5.5)**: Replaced single-queue view with multi-queue dashboard showing four stacked queue sections: Manual Review, Salesforce Logic Flags, Patch Queue, System Changes. Color accents applied to table body (not section containers): Manual Review (#fffef5 yellow), SF Logic (#fffaf5 orange), Patch Queue (#f8fbff blue), System Changes (#fafafa gray). Search bar is transparent/blended with header background. Patch Queue has inactive "Filter" button placeholder. Manual/SF Logic/System queues are placeholders for future data sources. `clearStaleReviewerData()` runs before `setMode()` to prevent stale queue counts. **Sticky Search (v1.5.6)**: Compact search bar fixed to top-right corner with dark themed container, stays visible while scrolling.

### Key Commands

-   **Validate configuration**: `python3 local_runner/validate_config.py --base config/config_pack.base.json --patch config/config_pack.example.patch.json`
-   **Run deterministic preview**: `python3 local_runner/run_local.py --base config/config_pack.base.json --patch config/config_pack.example.patch.json --standardized examples/standardized_dataset.example.json --out out/sf_packet.preview.json`
-   **Smoke test**: `bash scripts/replit_smoke.sh`

### Rule Schema

Rules follow a WHEN/THEN pattern with `rule_id`, `when` conditions (sheet, field, operator, value), and `then` actions (action, sheet, field, severity). Allowed operators include `IN`, `EQ`, `NEQ`, `CONTAINS`, `EXISTS`, `NOT_EXISTS`. Actions include `REQUIRE_BLANK`, `REQUIRE_PRESENT`, `SET_VALUE`. Severity levels are `info`, `warning`, `blocking`.

### Output Format

The preview generates an `sf_packet` containing `sf_summary` (contract counts), `sf_contract_results` (per-contract status), `sf_field_actions` (rule-triggered actions), and `sf_issues` (detected problems).

## External Dependencies

None by design. This repository exclusively uses the Python standard library. It has no external Python packages, database connections, API integrations, runtime services, or credentials/secrets.
