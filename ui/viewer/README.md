# Control Board Viewer

## Overview
A read-only, single-file HTML viewer for sf_packet artifacts. No build step, no dependencies, no external network requests.

**Version:** 0.6

## How to Open

### Option 1: Local file (simple)
Open `ui/viewer/index.html` directly in your browser.

**Note:** Due to browser security policies, fetching local JSON files may be blocked. Use Option 2 if tables don't load.

### Option 2: Local server (recommended)
From the repository root, run:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open: http://localhost:8080/ui/viewer/index.html

## Artifacts Read

The viewer reads sf_packet JSON files in this order:

| Priority | Path | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| 1 | `out/sf_packet.preview.json` | Generated preview output |
| 2 | `examples/expected_outputs/sf_packet.example.json` | Fallback example data |

Paths are relative to the repository root.

## Features

### Toolbar

The toolbar provides quick access to common commands:

| Button | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Validate | Validate configuration files (base + patch) |
| Preview Baseline | Generate preview with baseline example data |
| Preview Edge | Generate preview with edge case data |
| Smoke Baseline | Run smoke test against baseline expected output |
| Smoke Edge | Run smoke test against edge expected output |

**Copy-Only Default:** Clicking any toolbar button automatically copies the command to clipboard.

### Filters

Located below the toolbar, filters allow you to narrow down table results:

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Search** | Free-text search across all fields in all tables |
| **Severity Chips** | Toggle visibility of blocking/warning/info severity rows |
| **Status Chips** | Toggle visibility of ready/needs_review/blocked status rows |
| **Subtype Dropdown** | Filter Contract Results by detected_subtype |

### Universal Drilldown

Click any row in **any table** (Contract Results, Issues, or Field Actions) to open the Record Workbench drawer.

### Record Workbench

#### Join Identity with PRIMARY Indicator
The drawer header displays a **join identity pill** with visual emphasis on the PRIMARY key:
- **Green (PRIMARY):** The first non-null key in the join priority order
- **Gray (fallback):** Secondary keys in the identity

Priority order: `contract_key` → `file_url` → `file_name`

#### Tabs
The workbench has four tabs:

| Tab | Content |
|-----|---------|
| **Contract** | Full JSON of the matching contract record |
| **Issues** | All `sf_issues` rows matching the join identity |
| **Actions** | All `sf_field_actions` rows matching the join identity |
| **Change Log** | All `sf_change_log` rows matching the join identity |

### Selectable Records

In the Issues, Actions, and Change Log tabs, each row has a checkbox for selection:

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Checkbox** | Toggle individual record selection |
| **Select All** | Select all records in the current tab |
| **Clear** | Deselect all records in the current tab |
| **Add Selected to Patch** | Add selected records to the Patch Studio draft |

Selection persists within the current workbench session.

### Patch Studio (v0.6)

Access Patch Studio by clicking the green "Patch Studio" button in the Record Workbench. Patch Studio now has two tabs: **Draft** and **Preflight**.

#### Draft Tab

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Base Version** | Version this patch applies to (e.g., "0.1.0") |
| **Author** | Your email or identifier |
| **Rationale** | Description of why this patch is needed |

**Changes Preview:**
- Shows all records added to the patch draft
- Sorted by severity (blocking > warning > info), then sheet/field
- Remove individual items with the × button
- Clear all changes with the "Clear All" button

**Copy Outputs:**

| Button | Output Format |
|--------|---------------|
| **Copy Full Patch Draft (JSON)** | Complete `config_pack.patch.json` structure with sorted keys |
| **Copy Rule Mapping (JSON)** | Array of rule objects in patch-rule shape |
| **Copy Grouped Rule Draft** | WHEN/THEN/BECAUSE text with grouped rules |

#### Preflight Tab (v0.6)

The Preflight Gate ensures your patch draft is validated before PR submission.

**4-Step Checklist:**

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Base Version Check | Verify base.version matches patch.base_version |
| 2. Validation Report | Paste validator output to confirm config is valid |
| 3. Conflict Check | Confirm no rule conflicts exist |
| 4. Smoke Evidence | Paste smoke test results (baseline + optional edge) |

**Checklist Status Chips:**
- **Green (pass):** Evidence parsed successfully, step satisfied
- **Yellow (warn):** Evidence needs manual review
- **Red (fail):** Validation or smoke test failed
- **Gray (pending):** No evidence provided yet

**Paste-In Evidence Inputs:**
Each step has a text input where you paste terminal output. Click "Parse" to extract structured data:

| Input | What to Paste |
|-------|---------------|
| Base Version | Version string (e.g., "0.1.0") or JSON with version field |
| Validation Report | Output from `python3 local_runner/validate_config.py` |
| Conflict Check | Conflict report text, or type "reviewed" for manual confirmation |
| Smoke Baseline | Output from `bash scripts/replit_smoke.sh` |
| Smoke Edge | Output from `bash scripts/replit_smoke.sh edge` (optional) |
| SHA256 | Optional hash values for verification |

**Parsed Results:**
When parsing succeeds, a result panel shows extracted fields:
- Validation: status, base.version, patch.base_version, changes_count
- Conflicts: rendered as a table if any are found
- Smoke: PASS/FAIL status for baseline and edge

**Reset Evidence:**
Click "Reset All Evidence" to clear all preflight inputs without affecting the patch draft.

### Evidence Helper

Located in the Draft tab, provides copy-only buttons for:

| Button | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Smoke Baseline** | Baseline smoke test command |
| **Smoke Edge** | Edge case smoke test command |
| **Evidence Template** | Markdown template with placeholders for SHA256, commit, verification checklist |

### Copy PR Kit (with Evidence)

The "Copy PR Summary" button now generates a PR summary that includes an **Evidence section** populated from Preflight data:

| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| base.version | From Preflight or Draft field |
| patch.base_version | From parsed validation report or Draft field |
| Smoke Baseline | PASS/FAIL from parsed smoke output |
| Smoke Edge | PASS/FAIL or N/A if not provided |
| SHA256 | From preflight SHA256 input |

### Determinism Guarantees

All outputs follow these ordering rules:
- **Severity order:** blocking > warning > info
- **Join triplet:** contract_key → file_url → file_name (nulls last)
- **Secondary sort:** sheet, field, then type-specific fields
- **JSON:** All keys sorted alphabetically
- **Rule IDs:** Based on per-record primary key + index (no timestamps)

### State Persistence
The viewer persists your data in localStorage:
- Selected join identity (STORAGE_KEY)
- Patch draft including changes, author, rationale (PATCH_STORAGE_KEY)
- Preflight evidence blobs and parsed fields (PREFLIGHT_STORAGE_KEY)

### Summary Cards
Displays counts from `sf_summary`:
- Total contracts
- Ready (green)
- Needs Review (orange)
- Blocked (red)

### Tables
Three main tables with deterministic sorting:

1. **Contract Results** - `sf_contract_results`
   - Sorted by: contract_key (nulls last), file_url, file_name

2. **Issues** - `sf_issues`
   - Sorted by: severity, join triplet, sheet, field, issue_type

3. **Field Actions** - `sf_field_actions`
   - Sorted by: severity, join triplet, sheet, field, action

## Workflow

### Building a Patch Draft with Preflight Validation

9. Verify all 4 checklist steps show green or yellow status
10. Switch back to Draft tab and click "Copy Full Patch Draft (JSON)"
11. Use "Copy PR Summary" to get a PR description with evidence included

### Generating Evidence

1. Use Evidence Helper buttons (Draft tab) to copy smoke commands
